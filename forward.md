That's an excellent and very insightful question. The TRM paper describes a fascinating approach that, while fundamentally different
  from your agent's, offers powerful principles we can adapt to make your agent even better.

  You're right to see a connection. While your agent uses a large, pre-trained LLM and TRM uses a small, specialized network trained
  from scratch, the core idea in TRM—iterative refinement through recursion—can be translated into the world of LLM prompting.

  Directly implementing TRM isn't feasible as it would require replacing the LLM with a new, supervised model. However, we can
  absolutely borrow its core concepts to improve your agent's reasoning process. Here’s how:

  1. Implement Iterative Refinement (Inspired by TRM's Recursion)

  TRM separates its process into generating a latent "reasoning" feature (z) and then a final "answer" (y). We can mimic this by
  changing your agent's single-step decision into a two-step "Reason -> Act" process.

  Instead of one large prompt to get the final action, we would:

   1. Reasoning Step (Generate `z`): First, send a prompt to the LLM focused purely on internal strategic analysis.
       * Prompt: "You are Player {my_player_id} ({my_role}). Analyze the situation based on the history. What are the most likely roles 
         of other players? What are the biggest threats? What is your primary strategic goal for this turn? Think step-by-step. This is 
         your internal monologue."
   2. Action Step (Generate `y`): Take the LLM's strategic analysis from step 1 and use it to generate the final, public action.
       * Prompt: "Based on your internal monologue: '[output from step 1]', and the current game state, what is the best action to take 
         now? If discussion, what do you say? If voting, who do you vote for?"

  This forces the agent to "think" before it "acts," mirroring how TRM uses its latent feature z to refine its answer y. This would
  make the agent's actions more deliberate and strategically grounded.

  2. Introduce a Self-Correction Loop (Inspired by TRM's Deep Supervision)

  TRM uses "deep supervision" to improve its answer over multiple steps. We can create a similar effect with a "Critique and Refine"
  loop within a single turn. This would be especially powerful for complex discussion phases.

   1. Generate Initial Draft: The agent generates a first-draft discussion message as it does now.
   2. Self-Critique: The agent then calls the LLM again, feeding it its own draft.
       * Prompt: "I am Player {my_player_id} ({my_role}). I am about to say: '[initial draft]'. Is this the best possible message? Does 
         it align with my goal of staying subtle/hunting mafia? Could it be misinterpreted or reveal too much? How could this be 
         improved to be more effective?"
   3. Generate Final Action: The agent uses the LLM's critique to generate a final, improved message.

  This process of self-correction is analogous to TRM's multiple supervision steps and could significantly improve the quality and
  safety of the agent's actions, preventing it from making impulsive mistakes.

  Summary: How This Makes Your Agent Better

  By adapting these principles from TRM, your agent would move from being a simple "prompt-in, action-out" system to a more
  sophisticated reasoning engine:

   * More Deliberate: The "Reason -> Act" cycle ensures actions are based on explicit strategic thought.
   * More Robust: The "Critique and Refine" loop helps the agent catch its own potential errors and improve its communication.
   * Closer to Human Reasoning: This multi-step process more closely resembles how a human player might think through a turn,
     considering possibilities and refining their strategy before speaking.

  While the underlying technology is different, the philosophy of "recursive reasoning" from the TRM paper provides a clear and
  powerful path to enhancing your agent's intelligence.



  Idea 1: Dynamic Persona Adaptation

  Instead of having a fixed strategy for each role, the agent could dynamically adopt and change its persona based on the game's
  flow. This is about playing the social meta-game, not just the role.

  Concept: The agent actively manages how it's perceived by other players and can change its behavior if its current persona is
  proving ineffective.

  How it would work:

   1. Persona Selection: At the start of the game, the agent uses the LLM to pick a persona from a list like: "The Aggressive Accuser,"
      "The Quiet Analyst," "The Helpful but Naive Friend," "The Scared and Defensive Target."
   2. Persona-driven Actions: All prompts would be modified to include this persona.
       * Prompt: "You are the {Doctor}, and you have adopted the persona of 'The Quiet Analyst'. Based on this persona, what do you say 
         during the discussion?"
   3. The Novelty - Persona Critique & Shift: The agent periodically asks the LLM to evaluate its current persona's effectiveness.
       * Meta-Prompt: "My current persona is 'The Aggressive Accuser'. I am now being targeted by three other players. Is this persona 
         failing? Should I shift to a 'Scared and Defensive' persona to appear less threatening and redirect suspicion? Justify the 
         strategic shift."

  Why it's Novel: This moves the agent from simply following a role-based script to actively performing and managing a character. It's a
   higher level of social strategy, making the agent far less predictable and more human-like.


  Idea 2: Strategic Deception Campaigns

  For the Mafia role, we can elevate simple lying into planned, multi-turn information operations.

  Concept: The agent devises and executes a long-term plan to frame an innocent player or create a specific false narrative.

  How it would work:

   1. Campaign Planning (Mafia Only): At the start of the game or after a key event, the agent uses the LLM to create a plan.
       * Planning Prompt: "As Mafia, devise a three-step plan to frame Player 4 (an innocent) as the Detective. The plan should be 
         subtle and unfold over several turns."
   2. Store and Execute: The LLM might output a plan like:
       1. Turn 2: Publicly agree with a minor, irrelevant point Player 4 makes to create false rapport.
       2. Turn 3: After someone is killed, say 'Player 4 seemed to be onto something, maybe they know more than they let on,' subtly 
          implying they have an investigative role.
       3. Turn 4: If Player 4 makes an accusation, counter by saying 'That's a weak accusation for a supposed Detective,' fully 
          committing to the frame.
   3. The agent stores this plan in its memory and executes each step, tracking its progress.

  Why it's Novel: This gives the agent long-term strategic intent and the ability to execute complex, multi-stage deceptions. It's
  the difference between telling a lie and weaving a web of deceit, which is a hallmark of high-level play in social deduction games.
