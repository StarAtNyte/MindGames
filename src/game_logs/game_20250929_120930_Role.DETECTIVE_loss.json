Player 0 keeps bringing up Player 4, which feels like they\u2019re trying to focus attention elsewhere.

However, we need to start somewhere.

However, I need to hear more from the others before making a final decision.\n\nLet's hear the final thoughts from the other players before we vote.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I understand.

Their behavior contrasts sharply with Player 2\u2019s cautious approach, making them a prime suspect.]\n[Player 1] laiming to be Mafia and naming me as teammate is **information we have no obligation to believe**. Mafia players don\u2019t bus themselves and their partner for fun on Day 1; this is classic trolling or a terribly thought-out frame. Either way you ignore it.\n\n- Aggression isn\u2019t scum behavior; it\u2019s how town solves. I\u2019m asking questions because that\u2019s how we drag scum into contradictions. Sitting back and saying \u201cnothing to add\u201d (like Player 2) lets Mafia skate by.\n\n- The only sustained push right now is the circle of **Player 0 \u2192 Player 4 \u2192 Player 0**. Player 0 keeps repeating that Player 4 \u201ccould still be hiding something\u201d without once giving any concrete suspicion, and Player 4 gladly pivots back to me as soon as he notices heat is coming. That double shuffle looks very mutual.\n\nHere\u2019s my call: if you really want to hit scum today, vote **Player 0**. They\u2019re the one repeatedly feeding soft suspicion without ever committing, letting the air of uncertainty do their job for them.  \n\nVote [0].\n[Player 2]   \n**Round 3:**  \n\nPlayer 1\u2019s aggressive stance is concerning, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the only one to watch. Player 0 is trying to steer the conversation toward Player 4 and Player 1 without offering any real evidence. Their repeated mention of \"Player 4 could still be hiding something\" feels like a distraction.  \n\nPlayer 5\u2019s admission is suspicious, but I don\u2019t trust it completely. They could be trying to mislead us. However, I agree that Player 1 is being too aggressive and may be trying to deflect attention.  \n\nAfter considering everything, I believe the best choice is to vote for **Player 0**. They\u2019ve been the most inconsistent in their accusations and seem to be trying to manipulate the discussion.  \n\nVote [0].\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Their behavior contrasts sharply with Player 2\u2019s cautious approach, making them a prime suspect.]\n[Player 1] laiming to be Mafia and naming me as teammate is **information we have no obligation to believe**. Mafia players don\u2019t bus themselves and their partner for fun on Day 1; this is classic trolling or a terribly thought-out frame. Either way you ignore it.\n\n- Aggression isn\u2019t scum behavior; it\u2019s how town solves. I\u2019m asking questions because that\u2019s how we drag scum into contradictions. Sitting back and saying \u201cnothing to add\u201d (like Player 2) lets Mafia skate by.\n\n- The only sustained push right now is the circle of **Player 0 \u2192 Player 4 \u2192 Player 0**. Player 0 keeps repeating that Player 4 \u201ccould still be hiding something\u201d without once giving any concrete suspicion, and Player 4 gladly pivots back to me as soon as he notices heat is coming. That double shuffle looks very mutual.\n\nHere\u2019s my call: if you really want to hit scum today, vote **Player 0**.

Player 0 is trying to steer the conversation toward Player 4 and Player 1 without offering any real evidence. Their repeated mention of \"Player 4 could still be hiding something\" feels like a distraction.  \n\nPlayer 5\u2019s admission is suspicious, but I don\u2019t trust it completely. They could be trying to mislead us. However, I agree that Player 1 is being too aggressive and may be trying to deflect attention.  \n\nAfter considering everything, I believe the best choice is to vote for **Player 0**. They\u2019ve been the most inconsistent in their accusations and seem to be trying to manipulate the discussion.  \n\nVote [0].\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
