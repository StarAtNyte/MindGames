Since Player 0 is dead, we have to be extra cautious with our next eliminations. I haven't seen any suspicious activity from Player 4 or Player 2 yet, but Player 5's vote on Player 3 seems a bit suspicious, considering Player 5 just claimed to be neutral. I'll hold off on voting for now and see how the discussion unfolds.\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 4]  I used my Doctor ability last night to protect Player\u202f2, so they're definitely still alive.\u202fPlayer\u202f0 being killed was likely the Mafia\u2019s target, and since I chose to protect Player\u202f2, they weren\u2019t the victim.\u202fBased on the early chatter, I\u2019m a bit wary of Player\u202f5\u2019s random vote for themselves and the vague \u201cneutral\u201d claim \u2013 it feels like a classic try\u2011to\u2011blend tactic.\u202fI haven\u2019t noticed any obvious missteps from Player\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3, or\u202f4, but let\u2019s keep an eye on who consistently deflects or avoids giving solid statements.\u202fI don\u2019t have a vote yet \u2013 let\u2019s see what the next round brings.\n[Player 1] Okay, this is getting interesting! Player 5 voting for Player 3 right off the bat is definitely suspicious, even if they claimed to be neutral and then voted randomly (which doesn't make sense). Player 4 claiming Doctor is a bold move this early. If they're lying, they're digging a hole for themselves. Player 2 is being quiet, but early silence can be a strategy. Player 3 is pointing fingers at Player 5, which is fair given the vote.\n\nFor now, I'm leaning towards Player 5 being suspicious. I need more information, though.\n\n Okay, Player 5's vote for Player 3 seems very odd, especially after claiming neutrality. Player 4 claims to be the Doctor and protected Player 2. Player 2, can you confirm this? Also, Player 4, if you're the Doctor, do you have any reads other than protecting Player 2? Player 3, why do you think Player 5 voted for you?\n[Player 5] I'm still watching everyone, and I think we should analyze the information we have. Player4 claims to be the Doctor and protected Player2, which is a valid statement, but we can't confirm it yet. Player2's silence is still notable, and it's possible they're waiting for the right moment to strike. I don't think I voted for myself; that was just a misunderstanding. My vote for Player3 was based on the initial information available.\n\nTo directly answer your questions: Player2, you were indeed targeted by the Mafia last night, and if you're being truthful, Player4's claim about being the Doctor and protecting you could be valid. Player4, if you're the Doctor, it's essential to keep your protection strategy in mind for the next night. Player3, I voted for you because, at the time, it seemed like a neutral choice, but I understand why it raised suspicions.\n\nI'll keep observing and adjust my strategy accordingly. For now, I'll maintain my vote [3].\n[Player 3] [My thoughts] Player 5's consistent suspicion towards Player 3, combined with voting for Player 3, raises some suspicion. Player 4's claim of being the Doctor is crucial, but it remains unverifiable at this point. Player 2's silence could be strategic or suspicious. Overall, I need more information to identify the Mafia.\n\n[My move] I will vote to eliminate Player 5, as their behavior and voting pattern seem suspicious and could indicate Mafia affiliation.\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 4]  I appreciate everyone\u2019s input.\u202fFrom what we\u2019ve seen, Player\u202f5\u2019s initial vote for Player\u202f3 was odd, especially after claiming neutrality, and they\u2019ve continued to deflect without providing concrete evidence.\u202fPlayer\u202f3\u2019s suggestion to eliminate Player\u202f5 lines up with my own suspicions.\u202fPlayer\u202f2 has been unusually silent, but that can be a common tactic for both villagers and Mafia alike; lacking any direct evidence, I can\u2019t label them confidently.\u202fGiven the current information, I\u2019m leaning toward Player\u202f5 being the most likely Mafia member.\n\n**Vote:** I vote [5].\n[Player 1] Okay, Round 2 is heating up!\n\n*   Player 5 is digging themselves a hole. They \"misunderstood\" their own vote? Very sus.\n*   Player 4 is sticking to their Doctor claim and voting with the majority (Player 5).\n*   Player 3 is voting for Player 5, solidifying the suspicion.\n*   Player 2 is still silent. This is unusual, but could be a tactic. I need Player 2 to talk!\n\nI need Player 2 to confirm Player 4's Doctor claim. If Player 2 *doesn't* confirm it, Player 4 is likely Mafia. If Player 2 *does* confirm it, Player 4 is likely telling the truth meaning we might have a lead\n\nPlayer 5 is actively trying to confuse the rest of us and trying to spin. That sounds like a mafia.\n\nI will see how other people respond.\n\nPlayer 2 please say something to either confirm Player 4 as the doctor or not.\n\nMy Vote: [5]\n[Player 5] Since it's the discussion phase, I'll keep analyzing the information and adjusting my strategy. Player 4's Doctor claim is a strong statement, and Player 2's confirmation or denial will be crucial. For now, I'll continue to observe and respond accordingly.\n\nPlayer 2's silence is still notable. If you're the target of the Doctor's protection, it would be helpful to confirm or deny it.\n\nGiven the current votes and discussion, it seems like Player 5 (me) is under scrutiny. I'll maintain my current stance and continue to observe.\n\nTo directly address Player 1's question: I understand that my previous actions seemed suspicious, but I'm just trying to analyze the information available.\n\nSince the votes are being cast, I'll reiterate my current vote: [3].\n\nLet's see how the voting unfolds.\n[Player 3] [My analysis] The discussion is becoming quite tense, with suspicion centered on Player 5 and Player 4. Player 5's inconsistent statements and vote pattern suggest suspicious behavior, possibly Mafia. Player 4's claim of being the Doctor and protecting Player 2 warrants verification, but Player 2 has remained silent, which raises questions about their role or intentions.\n\n[My vote]: Given the current information, I will vote to eliminate Player 5, as their behavior appears suspicious and aligns with typical Mafia tactics of confusing and deflecting suspicion.\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 4] I agree with the others that Player\u202f5\u2019s erratic voting and contradictory statements are the most telling signs of Mafia activity. Player\u202f2\u2019s continued silence makes it hard to verify the Doctor claim, but the evidence points toward eliminating the most suspicious player.\n\n**Vote:** I vote [5].\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 3] [My vote] I vote to eliminate . Their inconsistent statements, suspicious voting behavior, and overall tone make them the most suspicious among the remaining players.\n[Player 1] [5]\n[GAME] Player 2 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties.",
