Eliminate villagers and gain majority.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nYour teammates are: Player 1, Player 3.\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to vote and eliminate a villager.\nWin by eliminating villagers until Mafia equal or outnumber them.\n\n[GAME] Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim.\nValid targets: [0], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 1] Let's discuss and agree on a target to eliminate.\n\nAs a Mafia member, my goal is to take out villagers and gain the upper hand. I see that there are 4 villagers and 2 Mafia members, including myself.\n\nPlayer 3 is my teammate, so I'll discuss with them to decide on a target. Since we can't directly communicate, I'll make a suggestion.\n\nI think we should target Player 0. They're a villager, and taking them out would be a good start.\n\nTeammate, are you okay with targeting [0]?",
