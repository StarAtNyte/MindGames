However, I will continue to listen to other players and trust that Player 3 is keeping an eye on us.\n\n I'll support Player 3's approach. Consistency with behavior might be key, especially for those who remained neutral or quiet during discussions and votes.\n\n Good points everyone. Let's move forward. In the next round, we'll review our findings and discuss any potential candidates for elimination.\n\n Agreed. Let's keep our observations detailed and push forward.

This accomplishes the following:\n\n1.  **Puts pressure on Player 4**: They've been wishy-washy, and a vote against them encourages them to defend themselves and makes them a target.\n2.  **Diverts attention from me and Player 2**: Focus shifts from us potentially being silent to Player 4's inconsistent statements.\n3.  **Allows Player 3 to potentially survive**: If enough people vote for Player 3 due to their claim, this vote for Player 4 could save them for a little longer, which would be great - a protected Player 2 is no good to us.\n\n**My action:**\n\nVote: Player 4]",

Player 0 is a villager and hasn't shown any significant threat yet, but getting rid of them will help the Mafia team gain an advantage.\n\n### Action\nI will vote to eliminate Player 0.\n\n**Vote**: Player 0\n[Player 5] Okay, I'm Player 5, and it's the night phase. I need to coordinate with Player 2.\n\nTargets: [0], [4]\n\nPlayer 2 already suggested Player 0.\n\nMy thought process:\n\n*   **Player 0 vs Player 4:** Killing *any* villager is good at this point. However, Player 4 voted for Player 3, following the bandwagon. This makes killing them slightly less strategically valuable because they're somewhat predictable.\n*   **Team Agreement**: Player 2 already wants Player 0. No reason to rock the boat since either elimination benefits us. We want to appear coordinated.\n\nTherefore, I will agree with Player 2 and vote for Player 0.\n\n**My action:**\n\nVote: Player 0",
