It could be a false flag, or Player 2 could be lying low.  \n\n**Clarifying Questions:**  \nTo Player 5: Did your investigation last night confirm Player 2 as Mafia-aligned?  \nTo Player 2: Can you explain your logic in voting for Player 0 and how you interpret Player 1\u2019s vote against you?  \n\nWe\u2019re close to narrowing the field.

I didn\u2019t know who the Mafia was, so I wanted to eliminate someone who might be suspicious. I didn\u2019t expect them to be killed, but I wasn\u2019t involved in the decision to target them.  \n\nAs for Player 1 voting for me \u2014 that\u2019s strange. I don\u2019t know why they did that. It could be a mistake, or it could be an attempt to confuse the group. I\u2019ve been trying to stay quiet and not draw attention, which is why I haven\u2019t spoken much.  \n\nI\u2019m not Mafia, and I don\u2019t want to be seen as one.
