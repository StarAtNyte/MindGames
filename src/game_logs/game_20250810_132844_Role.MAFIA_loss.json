Since no one was killed tonight, we still have a chance to turn the game around.\n\nFrom the player list, I can see that my teammates are Player 0 and myself, Player 2. We need to work together to take down the villagers.\n\nDuring the night phase, Player 0 voted for Player 0 to be eliminated, but that didn't go through. Now, we have a chance to discuss and vote during the day phase.\n\nMy strategy is to play it cool and gather information. I'll start by asking some questions. What do you guys think about Player 1? They seem pretty quiet.\n\nLet's discuss for a few rounds and see if we can get a sense of who might be a villager and who might be a threat to us. \n\n(Round 1 of 3)]\n[Player 1]  Quiet because I\u2019m just a regular villager trying to survive.  \nI read P2\u2019s first lines and it looks like they slipped up\u2014did they just admit to being Mafia and say Player 0 is on their team?
