Player 1 is definitely a Mafia member. We should target someone else. Let's focus on Player 0 or Player 5.\n[Player 0] ht have an intention to protect someone important. Player 5 could be someone with a role that has not yet been revealed and could be a potential suspect.\n\n I suggest we first confirm if Player 0 or Player 5 could be Mafia. We should ask questions and gather more information on their recent actions or conversations to determine their allegiance.\n\n I will not discuss my role directly. However, I am willing to answer any questions based on their behavior during the day to help the investigation. Let\u2019s proceed with caution and gather more evidence before making any accusations.\n\n After 3 rounds of discussion, a vote will be held. The player with the highest number of votes will be accused of being a Mafia member.\n\n I will not discuss further without seeing the evidence and hearing from other players. I propose we continue to gather information and vote based on the most convincing arguments.\n\n The discussion phase has concluded. Voting is now open.\n[Player 4] [I vote to eliminate Player 1, given the suspicion from previous testimonies. I believe it's crucial we act against confirmed Mafia members to protect our village.]",
