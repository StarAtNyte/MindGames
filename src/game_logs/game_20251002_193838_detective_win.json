Player 0 is removed as a suspect due to the Mafia strategy.\n\n**Final Round Summary:**\n\n- **Player 0** was eliminated based on their quiet behavior.\n- The Mafia continues to outmaneuver the villagers.\n\n---\n\n**Winning Strategy for Mafia:**\n\n- Maintain low profiles and observe.\n- Confuse the villagers by making seemingly innocent actions.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- Player 3 was the last Villager eliminated, and the Mafia won the game.\n[Player 5] [I think Player 0 is acting suspiciously because they shifted from defending Player 1 to immediately voting for Player 5. This sudden change in stance could indicate they know something or are trying to mislead. Let's gather more evidence before making another move.]\n[Player 1] [Okay, I understand. The scenario is:\n\n*   **Player 2:** Dead (Night 1)\n*   **Player 1:** Dead (Day 1)\n*   **Players Remaining:** Player 0, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nIt is the start of Day 2 - Round 1\n\n**Round 1 Discussion:**\n\nOkay, we've lost two players already, and we need to be careful and think this through. Player 0, you voted for Player 5 yesterday and now you want to vote to eliminate Player 5. Let's talk about that. Why the sudden change of heart? Player 5, you have seemed very determined. What are your thoughts and reasoning for removing Player 1 and Player 0? Player 4, you have been quiet through the last day phase. What are your reasons for not speaking? What is your read on all of us?\n\nWe need to figure this out. I am here to help the Village, but I need to know who to trust. Let's be open, and work this out together.]\n[Player 4] [{\n  \"role\": \"Mafia\",\n  \"action\": \"I will continue observing the villagers' discussions carefully, planting subtle suspicion on Player 0 and Player 5, as they seem most suspicious given their voting behaviors and silence.
