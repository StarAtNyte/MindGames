Let's not draw too much attention to ourselves. Who do we target next?\"\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - Round 1]  \nI agree, Player 4. We should be cautious, but I think it's important to start sharing our suspicions. I haven't noticed anything unusual about any specific player yet, but we should keep an eye on everyone. Does anyone have any clues or suspicions?\n[Player 5]  [DAY 1 - Round 1]  \nThanks, Player 0. I\u2019m still trying to piece together who might be lying or protecting someone. Since Player\u202f1 was taken last night, we should consider who could have been targeted\u2014maybe someone who seemed too quiet or overly defensive earlier? I didn\u2019t notice any strong alliances before the night, so I don\u2019t have a concrete suspect yet.  \n\nMy suggestion: let\u2019s each share one thing that stood out about another player\u2019s behavior so far\u2014something odd, evas or unusually helpful. That might give us a pattern to follow. Who wants to go next?\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - Round 1]  \nPlayer 2: \"Good idea, Player 5. Here\u2019s what I observed: Player 4 seemed extra cautious and kept glancing around as if checking for danger. It\u2019s unusual behavior for a Villager, especially when they\u2019re not directly threatened. Maybe they know something and are being careful?\"\n\nLet\u2019s see what others think about Player 4\u2019s behavior and if there are other patterns we can detect based on their responses.\n[Player 4]  [DAY 1 - Round 2]  \nPlayer 3, I appreciate the observation, but I was simply being cautious because the game is still in its early stages. I don\u2019t want to draw unnecessary attention. I believe we should focus on the bigger picture\u2014identifying the real threats.  \n\nI suspect Player 0 might be acting suspiciously. They were very calm after Player 1 was killed, and they asked for opinions rather than offering their own. That\u2019s not typical of a Villager. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re the Villain, but they might be hiding something.  \n\nLet\u2019s not waste time on baseless accusations. We need solid evidence or a clear target. Who agrees with me?\n[Player 0] [**Vote Summary So Far:**  \n- Player 4: Suspecting Player 0.  \n- Player 5: No direct suspicion, seeking clues.  \n- Player 2: Noted Player 4\u2019s cautious behavior.  \n- Player 4: Defending their cautiousness; suspecting Player 0.\n\nConsidering the discussions, I haven't seen any strong evidence to suspect anyone yet. However, Player 4\u2019s suspicion of Player 0 seems notable. I think we should consider that while staying cautious.\n\n**My stance:** I will vote to eliminate Player 0, since they are acting suspiciously and nobody has provided convincing reassurance.  \n\n---\n\n**Voting to eliminate Player 0.**]\n[Player 5] rofile. In early rounds that can be a sign of trying to avoid drawing attention, which sometimes (though not always) aligns with a hidden role.\n\n2. **Player\u202f0\u2019s calm demeanor** \u2013 Player\u202f0\u2019s calm response after the night killing and the request for opinions could be genuine village composure, but it also fits the pattern of a player who wants to stay neutral while gathering information.\n\n3. **Player\u202f2\u2019s silence** \u2013 So far, Player\u202f2 hasn\u2019t offered much beyond noting Player\u202f4\u2019s behavior. Their relative quietness could be strategic positioning.\n\nGiven these points, I\u2019m not convinced any single player stands out as the definitive Mafia yet. However, I\u2019m leaning toward **keeping an eye on Player\u202f4** because their extra caution feels a bit out of step for a typical villager at this stage. That said, I don\u2019t want to rush to a verdict without hearing the final round of thoughts.\n\nI\u2019ll hold off on casting a vote for now and look forward to the next round\u2019s input before we make a final decision.]\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 3] **Player 2: [DAY 1 - Round 2]**\nPlayer 0, based on your mention of Player 4\u2019s cautious behavior, I also noticed that Player 4\u2019s approach seems a bit different. They seem almost too cautious, as though they are trying to avoid suspicion themselves. Their actions give off a feeling that they may be hiding something.\n\nI agree with the suspicions about Player 0, but Player 4\u2019s behavior also feels amiss. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly, but their actions feel too calculated to be typical for a Villager.\n\nSince there\u2019s no solid evidence yet, I think we should continue to observe everyone carefully. I will hold off on voting for now.\n\n---\n\n**My stance: Hold off on voting for now. I will consider the final round\u2019s input before making a decision.**\n\n---\n\n**No vote for now.**\n[Player 4]  [DAY 1 - Round 3]  \nI understand the concerns, but I stand by my suspicion of Player 0. Their lack of direct opinion and calmness after Player 1\u2019s elimination is too calculated to be a coincidence. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re the only suspect, but they\u2019re the most likely at this point.  \n\nAs for Player 2, their silence and focus on me is suspicious too. They may be trying to shift attention away from themselves.  \n\nI\u2019ll stick with my vote to eliminate Player 0. Let\u2019s not waste time\u2014this is our chance to move forward.  \n\n**Voting to eliminate Player 0.**\n[Player 0]  Voting results:\n- Player 4: Votes to eliminate Player 0.\n- Player 5: Abstains or no vote yet.\n- Player 2: Abstains or no vote yet.\n- Player 3: Abstains or no vote yet.\n\n**Majority vote: Player 0 will be eliminated.**\n\n Player 0 has been eliminated.

However, I'll keep a close eye on Player 4\u2019s behavior tonight, as their cautious nature could still be a red flag.\n\n[Vote Summary So Far:  \n- Player 4: Votes to eliminate Player 0.  \n- Player 5: Holds back or no vote.  \n- Player 3: Holds back or no vote.  \n- Player 2: Holds back or no vote. ]\n\nNo action from my end tonight.\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

We should focus on gathering more information, but I believe eliminating Player 4 might help us clarify things.\n\n  [DAY 2 - Round 1]  \nI agree that Player 4\u2019s cautiousness could be a sign of guilt. Their behavior last round was too calculated. But I also think Player 3\u2019s silence and refusal to cast a clear vote are suspicious. We need to decide who poses the most immediate threat.\n\n  [DAY 2 - Round 1]  \nMy focus is on avoiding hasty decisions. I believe the suspicions around Player 4 are valid, but we should also consider the possibility that someone might be trying to divert attention. We need more discussion before voting.\n\n  [DAY 2 - Round 1]  \nI\u2019ve been observing everyone. No one has given me enough evidence to be certain, but I agree Player 4 looks suspicious because of their behavior. I lean towards voting them out if others agree.\n\nBased on current suspicions, who do you all think should be our next target?\n[Player 4]  [DAY 2 - Round 1]  \nPlayer 3, I\u2019m surprised by your vote. I\u2019ve been trying to help us identify the Mafia, not hide behind it. My caution is a survival tactic, not a sign of guilt.  \n\nAs for Player 0, they were eliminated already, so we need to focus on the current players. I still believe Player 2 is hiding something. They\u2019ve been too quiet and focused on me, which is suspicious.  \n\nLet\u2019s not let emotion drive our decisions. We need to stick to logic and evidence.
