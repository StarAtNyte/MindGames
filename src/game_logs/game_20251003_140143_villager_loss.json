Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 3 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Round 1] I think we should consider who was acting strangely yesterday. Player\u202f0 seemed unusually quiet, and they didn't comment much after the night kill. It might be worth keeping an eye on them.\n\n[Round 2] Also, Player\u202f5 has been defensive in previous discussions, which could be a sign they're trying to hide something. We should ask them directly about their thoughts on the recent events.\n\n[Round 3] My gut says we need to focus our vote on someone who hasn't contributed much to the conversation today. I'm leaning towards voting for Player\u202f4, unless new information comes up.\n[Player 1]  [Round 1] I agree that Player 0's silence is suspicious. It's possible they're trying not to reveal too much. However, we should also consider the fact that we just started the game, and it's normal for players to take some time to understand the dynamics.\n\n[Round 2] I also noticed Player 5 being defensive, but it's also possible they're just being cautious. I'll ask Player 5 directly: What makes you think you're not a target for us Mafia? What's your reasoning behind being so defensive?\n\n[Round 3] After hearing Player 2's thoughts, I'm leaning towards voting for Player 4 as well. They haven't said much so far, and it's better to eliminate someone who's not contributing much to the discussion. Let's vote for Player 4.\n[Player 4] [Okay, I understand. Both Player 2 and Player 1 are considering voting for me. I understand their reasoning, since I haven't spoken much.\n\nHowever, I was the one who was targeted last night and I am the Doctor! If I get killed, we lose a valuable member. It is in my best interest to be alive and to figure out who the Mafia are.\n\nI will ask: Both Player 2 and Player 1, why are you so certain that I am Mafia? Are you just assuming or do you have a better reason?]",
