Let's see how Player 5 responds and if any suspicious behavior emerges in the next round.\n[Player 0]  [Round 2:\nPlayer 2 and Player 1 have made some valid points. It's true that Player 5's accusations could be seen as fishing for a mis-elimination. However, it's also possible that Player 5 is genuinely concerned and trying to contribute to the discussion. I'll continue to observe and not jump to conclusions. I still don't see any clear targets, but Player 5's behavior is worth keeping an eye on. Let's hear more from everyone in the next round.] \n\nAs the game is still in the discussion phase, I will continue to follow the instructions and maintain a neutral stance while keeping my Mafia role in mind. My next step will be to respond in Round 3 and then cast a vote.\n[Player 5] [Why do you think they kept glancing around the room? And Player 0, you mentioned blending in—why not just stay silent instead of joining in the discussion? What are you really up to? I mean, it’s one thing to participate, but why the constant glances? It makes me wonder if there’s something you’re trying to hide.]\n[Player 3] y to make definitive accusations. Let's continue to discuss and observe carefully.\n\n****\n\nI agree with Player 1. Let's keep an open mind but stay vigilant. Player 5’s behavior does seem a bit off, but we need more evidence before making a final decision. I will continue to monitor and vote for Player 4.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Vote at the end of the day:]**\n\nI reaffirm my vote for Player 4 based on the nervous behavior observed.\n\n---\n\n****\n\nI appreciate the cautious approach. Player 5’s behavior does seem a bit suspicious, but it’s important to let the game play out a bit more. I will vote for Player 4 as well, based on the nervous behavior observed.\n\n---\n\n**[Final Night Phase Decision:]**\n\n is chosen to be eliminated by the villagers. Let’s hope the next night goes well and we can continue to make progress.\n\n---\n\n**[Night phase:]**\n\n*I vote to eliminate .*\n\n---\n\n**[Outcome:]**\n\n has been eliminated. The game continues with the next night phase.\n[Player 4]   \n[Investigate: Player 2]\n[Player 2]  [Round 2:  \nPlayer 4’s “investigate” on me is a classic deflection—zero substance, just a ping to see if I’ll flinch. Meanwhile, Player 5 keeps hammering the same two weak points (glances + “why not silent?”) without adding anything new. That repetition feels like scum trying to manufacture a narrative rather than genuine scum-hunting.  \n\nI’m still not ready to vote, but the pressure on me from 4 and the tunnel from 5 are both worth noting. Let’s see who else steps up or backs off.\n[Player 1]  [Round 3:  \nBased on everything we've discussed so far, I think Player 5 has been the most suspicious with their aggressive questioning and attempts to push blame onto others. Player 2 has raised some good points, but I think the behavior of Player 5 warrants a vote.  \n\nI'm leaning towards voting for Player 5 today, as their actions seem more likely to be from someone trying to deflect suspicion or manipulate the conversation. What does everyone else think?]\n[Player 0] ubtly guiding the conversation. Since Player 1 is leaning towards voting for Player 5, I will respond in a way that keeps the discussion open.\n\nI agree that Player 5's behavior has been quite assertive, but we should also consider the possibility that they are genuinely trying to uncover the truth. However, the repeated focus on Player 0 and Player 4 could be seen as a attempt to distract from their own potential role. Let's not forget that Player 4 was initially suspected of being nervous, and now they've been investigated. We should wait for the outcome of the investigation before making a final decision.\n\nI will vote for Player 5.\n\n**[Final Vote at the end of the day:]**\n\nI vote for Player 5.\n\n**[Night phase:]**\n\nSince my teammate Player 3 was eliminated, I will make a decision based on the current situation. I will vote to eliminate Player 2, as they have been quite observant and might become a threat to our team.\n\n is my target.\n\n**Move during Night phase:**\n''\n[Player 5] [Player 2, that vote came out of nowhere—why are you targeting me? And Player 0, you seem to be subtly steering the conversation. What’s up with that? I thought we were supposed to be looking out for each other. Player 4, you mentioned feeling nervous earlier; do you still feel that way, or are you just trying to throw us off? We need to]\n[Player 3] **[Night phase:]**\n\nGiven the tension and the need to maintain cohesion within the Mafia team, I will follow through with the plan and eliminate Player 2, as they seem to be the most observant and could pose a threat if they align themselves with the villagers.\n\n**Move during Night phase:**\n'Player 2'\n\n---\n\nThis vote will help us stay on track and maintain control over the game dynamics. Now, let’s see how the villagers react during the daytime discussion.\n[Player 4]    \n[Investigate: Player 2]\n[Player 2]  [Round 3:  \nI’m already dead—night-killed—so I can’t speak or vote. Good luck, village. Remember:  \n- Player 0 subtly steered toward eliminating me after I started pushing Player 5.  \n- Player 5 kept tunneling the same weak points, never shifting.  \n- Player 3 stayed silent all day, then flipped to “vote 4” without adding reasoning.  \n\nIf I’m gone and the kill went through, at least one (probably two) of {0, 3, 5} is Mafia. Dig there.]\n\n(Final words only; no vote.)\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 4]   \n[Vote: 5]\n[Player 2] [5]\n[Player 1]  [Round 3:\nAfter hearing everyone's opinions, I still feel that Player 5’s behavior has been quite suspicious—persistently pushing accusations without solid evidence and directing attention away from themselves. While Player 4 was nervous earlier, I believe Player 5’s aggressive stance seems more like scum trying to lead us astray.  \n\nI will cast my vote for Player 5, as I think they are the most likely to be Mafia based on their pattern of behavior. Let's see if this helps us identify the culprits and move closer to victory.]\n[GAME] Player 5 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target.
