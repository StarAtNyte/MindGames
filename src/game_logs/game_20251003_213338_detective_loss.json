I\u2019ve been trying to read the room, and honestly, the only people left are you, me, and Player 5. Since three villagers have already been eliminated, that means either you or Player 5 must be the last mafia member. I don\u2019t have any special powers, so I have to rely on what I\u2019ve seen in the discussions. Player 5 has been pretty quiet, but you\u2019ve been leading the conversations a lot, Player 0. That makes me a bit suspicious of you. What do you have to say for yourself?]\n[Player 1] [**Player\u202f0:** I hear you, Player\u202f2, and I appreciate the analysis. It\u2019s true that we\u2019re down to the three of us, and the stakes are high. From my perspective, the fact that you\u2019re suddenly pointing fingers at me makes me a bit uneasy. You\u2019ve been pretty quiet until just now, and in a game like this the quiet ones can sometimes be the ones trying to stay under the radar.\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, the only real clue we have is who\u2019s been steering the conversation. I\u2019ve been trying to keep everyone on track, asking questions, and gauging reactions. You\u2019ve only spoken up once now, and that could be a sign you\u2019re trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself.\n\nI think the safest move for the village is to eliminate the player who has the least to lose by staying silent \u2013 which, in this case, is you, Player\u202f2. What do the rest of you think? \n\n*Vote:* I\u2019m voting to lynch **Player\u202f2**.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 0] [2]",
