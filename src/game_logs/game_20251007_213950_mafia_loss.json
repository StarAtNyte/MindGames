Player 1 was the Doctor, so even if they’re dead, the Doctor role doesn’t disappear. Unless there are multiple Doctors, but the description says the Doctor protects one player, so probably one Doctor. Player 4, are you implying that Player 3 is Mafia and you are the Doctor? That would mean they were targeting you, but they didn't vote.]\n (dead)\n Mafia is claiming Player 4 is the Doctor, but let's see the results.\n Mafia lynched Player 3, and Player 0 is alive.\n Player 4 might be the Doctor now? But the Doctor was Player 1, so it can't be. Player 4 is probably Mafia.\n[Player 3] [4]\n[GAME] Player 0 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties.\n[Player 0] [0]\n[Player 4] [3]\n[Player 2] [4]\n[GAME] Player 4 was eliminated by vote.\n[GAME] Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim.\nValid targets: [1], [2], [3]",
