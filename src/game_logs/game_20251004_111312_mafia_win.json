I'll investigate Player 2 tonight. If all goes well, that's a good move in one direction.\n\n**Vote:**\n\nPlayer 2.]\n[Player 1]  under heavy scrutiny due to their silence, it's likely that the villagers will lynch them.

Player 2 has been lynched.\n\nRemaining players: Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\n** Night falls. Mafia, choose a victim.**\nValid targets: [3], [4], [5]\n\nAs the remaining Mafia member (Player 1), I need to decide on a target to eliminate.\n\nI'll choose ****.\n\nReasoning: Player 3 has been investigating and seems to be a relatively active and engaged player. Eliminating them could disrupt the villagers' ability to gather information and make it harder for them to identify me as the remaining Mafia member.\n\nLet's see how the game unfolds.\n\n**: **\n[Player 4] tions.\n\n2) **Per-Player Reads (Alive Only)**  \n   - Player 3 \u2014 read: Leaning Mafia; their reluctance to engage and the lack of clear reasoning in their statements suggest an attempt to avoid scrutiny.  \n   - Player 5 \u2014 read: Leaning Villager; they have been more vocal and engaged, contributing to the discussions and pushing for clarity.  \n\n3) **Top Suspicion** \u2014 Player 3 stands out as a primary suspect due to their evasive behavior and tendency to avoid the spotlight, which aligns with common Mafia strategies.\n\n4) **Questions / Pressure** \u2014 What are your thoughts on the lynching of Player 2? Can you clarify your rationale for your previous statements regarding Player 4?\n\n5) **Plan for Today** \u2014 \n   - Pressure Player 3 for more active participation and clearer reasoning in their statements. \n   - Demand clarity on their views regarding recent events and the remaining players.\n   - Monitor reactions to see if any inconsistencies arise, particularly in response to Player 2's elimination.]\n[Player 5] [I\u2019m Player 5, a Villager.  \nNight kill was Player 3.  \nAlive: Player 1, Player 4, Player 5.\n\nDay 2 \u2013 3 rounds of discussion, then vote.\n\nRound 1  \nI\u2019ll open with a quick triangulation.  \n- Player 1: yesterday defended Player 2 (the lynched Mafia) and tried to steer heat toward Player 3. Now that 3 is dead, that defense looks worse.  \n- Player 4: pushed Player 3 yesterday, which is now a \u201ccorrect\u201d result, but could also be distancing.  \n- Me: confirmed Villager.\n\nMy working hypothesis is that exactly one scum remains, and it\u2019s either 1 or 4.  \nI want to hear both of them explain why the other might be the last Mafia, and why they themselves are town.]",
