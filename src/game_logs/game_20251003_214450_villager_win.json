Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] I'll be strategic and focus on gathering information during the discussions to identify the Mafia members. Let's begin.\n\n[DAY 1 - ROUND 1] I think it's important we all share our observations and any suspicions we may have. Since Player 0 was killed during the night, we need to be cautious and not jump to conclusions. Let's start by discussing who we think might be the Mafia and why. I'll be listening carefully to everyone's statements.\n[Player 4]  Based on the discussions so far, I think we should keep an eye on Player 1. They\u2019re quite vocal and might be trying to cover up their own suspicions, or perhaps they're just gathering information as they said. However, we should also consider other players' behaviors and statements carefully. I suggest we observe closely in these next rounds.\n[Player 3] an eye out for any inconsistent statements or suspicious behavior as we talk.\n\n[DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \n I\u2019ve noticed that Player\u202f2 hasn\u2019t said much yet, which isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of guilt, but silence can be a tactic to avoid drawing attention. Meanwhile, Player\u202f4 has already pointed a finger at Player\u202f1. It\u2019s good to be vigilant, but I\u2019d like to hear more from Player\u202f5 and Player\u202f2 before forming a solid suspicion. Does anyone have any observations from previous rounds that might help us narrow it down?\n\n[DAY 1 - ROUND 3]  \n Based on what we\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m leaning toward the idea that the remaining Mafia might be trying to stay under the radar. Player\u202f2\u2019s lack of participation could be an attempt to avoid scrutiny, while Player\u202f5 has remained quiet but hasn\u2019t made any defensive accusations. Given the limited information, I think the safest bet is to target the player who has contributed the least to our investigation so far.\n\n**Vote:** I vote to lynch **Player\u202f2**.",

However, their silence means they haven\u2019t contributed any real information to help the village, and the \u201cDoctor\u201d claim is unverified.  \n\nGiven the pattern of inconsistent and manipulative statements, the strongest suspicion falls on **Player\u202f4**.\n\n**Vote:** I vote to lynch **Player\u202f4**.]",
