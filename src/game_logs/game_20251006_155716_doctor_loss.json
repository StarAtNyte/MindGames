I'm ready to vote at the end of the discussions.\n\nMy VOTE will depend on the discussion and what has been discussed. I will not cast a vote during the discussion.]\n[Player 3] **Discussion Summary:**\n\n- Player 4 was killed last night; some believe they might have been targeted by the Mafia or were involved in suspicious activity.\n- Players are cautious, emphasizing careful analysis before voting.\n- Player 5 suspects Player 3 based on the recent events.\n- Player 1 and Player 2 suggest keeping observation on all players, including Player 3, but haven't made direct accusations.\n- Player 0 is listening and refraining from voting until more information is available.\n\n**Voting Decision:**\n\nI will vote to eliminate **Player 3** based on the suspicion raised by Player 5 and the fact that Player 3 was one of the few not strongly cleared or implicated. Their behavior seems more cautious and less transparent, which could be a mafia strategy to stay under the radar.\n\n**[Vote: Player 3]**\n[Player 2] **[Vote: Player 3]**\n\nGiven the summary of the discussion and the votes so far:\n\n- Player 5 suggested Player 3 as potentially suspicious due to lack of activity and bringing up the targeted idea.\n- The group agrees on the importance of careful analysis but hasn't reached conclusive evidence against any player except confirming Player 2’s innocence.\n- Voting to eliminate Player 3 aligns with the cautious and observational approach mentioned by Player 1 and Player 2.\n\nLet's proceed to the next phase and continue keeping an eye on Player 3 for any suspicious behavior.\n[Player 5]  [I confirm my vote to eliminate Player 3. They have not shown clear loyalty to the village and their behavior is too cautious. It’s possible they are the Mafia. Let’s move forward with the vote.]\n[Player 1] [\"I think Player 2 makes some valid points there. We should be careful about rushing to judgment. That's an interesting observation—worth considering. I agree we need to look at the evidence carefully.\"]\n[Player 0] Okay, I understand. My vote is on Player 3, as described in the last answer.\n\n[Player 0: Vote: Player 3]\n[Player 3]  The vote has resulted in Player 3 being eliminated.
