I'm wary of anyone who isn't contributing directly to figuring out who killed Player 2.]\n[Player 0]  I think there's something off about Player 5's comment as well, especially being Day 1 and no previous patterns to reference. It's either a lucky guess or someone trying to position themselves suspiciously high in the conversation flow.  \n\nAlso, I want to know where everyone was at last night. Did anyone see or hear anything specific?  Since we have no real data yet, it\u2019s best we try narrowing down possible suspects based on their behavior. Player 5 is making big claims without providing any evidence and is deflecting questions. I think Player 5 should be under serious scrutiny.\n[Player 3]  I agree with the concerns raised about Player 5. Their vague comments about \"patterns\" on Day 1 seem suspicious, especially after Player 2 was killed. Without any prior information, it's unlikely they have a solid basis for their claims. I think we need to focus on gathering more concrete evidence or observations rather than relying on unverified theories. Let\u2019s ask everyone where they were during the night and if they noticed anything unusual.\n[Player 5] [Let me break down what I've observed so far and share my analysis.]\n[Player 4]  \u201cIt's exactly this sort of deflective behavior that needs to be exposed. Player 5 just pivoted from their vague comments to suddenly offering 'analysis' - that's classic red flag behavior. Someone who's trying to control the narrative while hiding their true role. I don't know what patterns they think they're seeing when there are no data points, but they're definitely trying to manipulate the discussion flow. Let's not let them get away with this.\u201d [Vote for Player 5]\n[Player 1]  Player 4 is right, Player 5. You *are* deflecting. You made a vague comment, and when pressed, instead of clarifying, you doubled down on the \"analysis.\" As Player 0 and Player 3 also picked up on, there *are* no patterns to see yet! Player 2 is dead, and you're talking about \"patterns\"? What are you even seeing? It feels like you're trying to create a narrative to look smart, or worse, to obscure something. We need people who are focused on *solving* this, not just talking about it. I'm really leaning towards voting Player 5.\n[Player 0]  I completely agree with Players 1, 3, and 4. Player 5 is acting like they have some kind of insight when there's absolutely nothing to base it on. That kind of behavior is suspicious, especially coming right after a player was killed. You either have information or you don't \u2013 and Player 5 clearly doesn't, yet they're trying to position themselves as if they do. \n\nOn top of that, their refusal to directly answer the question about where they were last night and what they saw only makes them look more guilty by omission. The rest of us are actively trying to find out who killed Player 2, but Player 5 seems more interested in steering the conversation into abstract analysis and distractions.\n\nI'm going to cast my vote for Player 5 as well. If they're innocent, they should be able to explain why they're acting this way. But right now, they're the only person throwing up smoke instead of helping us find the killer. We can't afford to let that go unchecked.\n\n[Vote for Player 5]\n[Player 3]  [Protect Player 4]\n[Player 5] [I'm analyzing behavioral patterns and inconsistencies. Anyone else notice suspicious deflection tactics?]\n[Player 4]   \"Player 5 tried to dodge the pattern conversation, but then claimed they can analyze behavioral inconsistencies. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The real issue here is they still haven't confirmed where they *were* last night, which directly contradicts our current priorities. Everyone else has been cooperating to solve the crime, but Player 5 is the only one trying to prevaricate. This is exactly the kind of *pattern* I see in someone hiding their involvement in Player 2's elimination. I now believe there is a pattern - it's called lying under oath for covering up a murder.\"\n[Vote for Player 5]\n[Player 1]   Player 4, you've hit the nail on the head. Player 5, you keep talking about \"patterns\" and \"analysis\" but you're the one *behaving* like a pattern. You're deflecting, you're not giving straight answers about last night, and you're trying to lead us down a rabbit hole of abstract ideas instead of focusing on the cold, hard fact that Player 2 is dead.\n\nWe're all trying to figure out who did this, and the people who seem to be helping are the ones providing concrete observations or asking relevant questions. You, on the other hand, are speaking in riddles and making vague pronouncements. Honestly, your continued insistence on \"patterns\" when we have zero data points is incredibly suspicious. It feels like a classic Mafia tactic to try and sound intelligent while obscuring the truth.\n\nI'm with Player 4, Player 0, and Player 3. Player 5, your behavior is too evasive.
