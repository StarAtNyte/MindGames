Today we only need to hit one of them; whichever flips first will confirm or deny the theory.\n\nVote: Player 2\n[Player 0] [I agree with the analysis presented by Players\u202f1 and\u202f5.

I didn't notice anything unusual last night, but I'm fine, so I guess Player 4's protection worked? I'm not sure if I was the target, but it's possible. I'll wait for more information before making any conclusions.\n\nTo keep the discussion going: Let's hear from Player 3's perspective, even though they're no longer with us. Did anyone notice anything about their behavior or any potential threats they might have received? \n\nMy response is: Let's keep gathering information and discussing before making a voting decision.]\n[Player 1]   \nHold up\u2014Player 2 literally just answered for Player 4 with \u201cI guess Player 4\u2019s protection worked?\u201d That\u2019s not how a cleared villager talks. A real villager would either confirm they were targeted or shrug it off; they wouldn\u2019t spontaneously validate 4\u2019s unproven Doctor claim.  \n\nThe slip: 2 speaks for 4 instead of for themselves. That\u2019s buddy-behavior; they\u2019re coordinating.  \n\nSimplest story: 2 and 4 are the scum-team. Night-kill on 3 was clean (no Doc involved), and today they\u2019re weaving a shared lie to grab towncred.  \n\nI\u2019m keeping my vote loose for now, but the scent is strongest on 2.\n[Player 0] \n2. **Player\u202f4** (who claimed to be the Doctor) says they protected Player\u202f2, but we have no way to confirm that protection actually happened.\n\nTo move forward I have two quick questions:\n\n- **Player\u202f2**, can you state clearly whether you think you were the Mafia\u2019s target last night? If you were, did you feel any \u201cprotection\u201d effect (e.g., you were safe from the kill)? A simple \u201cyes, I was targeted and survived\u201d or \u201cno, I wasn\u2019t targeted\u201d will help.\n\n- **Player\u202f4**, if you truly are the Doctor, can you confirm whether you have a single-use protection per night and whether you chose Player\u202f2 deliberately because you suspected them? Also, can you tell us if any other player reported being targeted?\n\nBased on the current information, I\u2019m leaning toward voting for **Player\u202f2** if they cannot convincingly prove they were targeted and survived without help. However, I\u2019ll hold the final vote until we get those clarifications. Let\u2019s keep the discussion open for one more round and then decide.]\n[Player 5]  Let's focus on the facts. Player 2 was protected, and Player 3 was killed. Player 4 claims to be the Doctor, but their story has inconsistencies. Player 2's response was suspicious, and Player 1 raised valid concerns. We need to be cautious. \n\nI will vote for Player 2 based on the suspicious behavior and lack of clear evidence supporting Player 4's claim. \n\nVote: Player 2\n[Player 2] [0]\n[Player 4]  game.\n\nAs the Doctor, I want to clarify that my role is to protect one player each night. I chose to protect Player2, and it appears that the Mafia targeted them but was unsuccessful. I understand that my claim is hard to verify, but I'm sticking to my original statement.\n\nTo address Player1's concerns: I understand that my claim might seem convenient, but I'm willing to provide more information to alleviate doubts. I didn't know that Player3 was the actual target, and I'm still trying to understand the Mafia's behavior.\n\nTo directly answer Player0's questions: As the Doctor, I have a single-use protection per night, and I chose to protect Player2 because I wanted to keep them safe. I didn't have any prior information about the Mafia's target.\n\nMy response is: Let's be cautious and consider the facts before making a voting decision. I still believe that understanding the Mafia's target is crucial to our success.\n\nVote: [To be determined in the next round, but for now, I will not vote]\n[Player 1]   \n\nRight now we have three lines of possible reality:\n\n1. 4 is the real Doc who saved 2, so 3 was the straight kill.\n2. 4 is lying, there was no Doc save, and 3 was the kill\u2014meaning 4 could still be Mafia.  \n3. 2 & 4 are Mafia mates staging the \u201cDoc save\u201d theater to look town-clear.\n\nEvidence so far:\n\u2013 2\u2019s phrasing \u201cI guess 4\u2019s protection worked\u201d is plain weird for a villager; it pre-emptively vouches for an unproven claim.  \n\u2013 4 keeps repeating the claim while stalling on a concrete stance.  \n\u2013 No counter-claim Doctor has stepped up in this small game; odds of a second protection role are tiny.  \n\nTherefore the cleanest mafia-pair explanation is still 2 & 4. Today we only need to hit one of them; whichever flips first will confirm or deny the theory.\n\nVote: Player 2\n[Player 0] [I agree with the analysis presented by Players\u202f1 and\u202f5. The odd phrasing from Player\u202f2 and the unverified Doctor claim from Player\u202f4 make them the most suspicious duo. Until we get concrete proof otherwise, the safest move is to eliminate one of the likely Mafia members.\n\n**Vote: Player\u202f2**]\n[Player 5] [Vote: Player 2]\n[Player 2] [0]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 1] [2]\n[Player 4] To follow the required format and make a voting decision, I will analyze the discussion and make a choice.\n\nThe discussion has highlighted suspicious behavior from Player 2 and an unverified claim from Player 4 (the Doctor). Player 1 raised valid concerns about the coordination between Player 2 and Player 4, suggesting they might be working together.\n\nSince the majority has voted for Player 2, and considering the suspicious behavior and lack of clear evidence supporting Player 4's claim, I will align my vote with the majority.\n\nVote: [2]\n[Player 0] [2]",
