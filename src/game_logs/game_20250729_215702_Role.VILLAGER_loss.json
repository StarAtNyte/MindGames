Let's keep sharing our observations and see if we can identify any potential red flags or suspicious behavior.\"\n[Player 1]   \n[As a Mafia member, I need to continue acting naturally while subtly influencing the discussion in ways that benefit my team. Since the conversation so far has remained general and non-confrontational, I should keep it that way to avoid raising suspicion. I\u2019ll respond to the discussion in a way that promotes further dialogue without pointing fingers too soon.]\n\n\"I think we're all being pretty reasonable so far, which can actually make it harder to tell who's lying. Maybe we should go around and have everyone briefly share how they're feeling about the game right now \u2014 it might reveal something subtle we can use later.\"\n[Player 5] [Okay, I'm Player 5, a Villager.\n\nRound 2:\n\nEveryone is still playing it cool. Player 3 is agreeing with Player 2 and Player 5 (me), trying to seem agreeable. Player 1 is suggesting a round-robin approach to gauge feelings. This is also pretty reasonable.\n\nMy response for Round 2: \"I like Player 1's idea. Let's go around and share how we're feeling. I'm feeling cautious, it's early days, and anyone could be the Mafia. I don't have any strong reads yet.\"]\n[Player 2]   \n[Protect Player 5]\n[Player 4] [Let me break down what I've observed so far and share my analysis.]\n[Player 3] [\"Let's analyze the discussion and see if we can pick up on any clues. Player 1 suggested we share our feelings, so I'll start. I'm feeling a bit uneasy, given that Player 0 was eliminated so quickly. I think it's a good idea to keep observing and discussing before making any accusations.\"]\n[Player 1]  [\"I'm feeling cautious as well. Like Player3 said, it's early, and we need to be careful with our accusations. Let's hear from Player4 next \u2014 what are your feelings on the current situation?\"]\n[Player 5]  [Okay, I'm Player 5, a Villager.\n\nRound 3:\n\nStill no one is sticking their neck out too far. Player 4 is about to share their analysis, which will be interesting. Player 3 and Player 1 are both playing the cautious, 'feeling uneasy' card. Standard mafia fare early on, trying to blend in.\n\nMy response for Round 3: \"Looking forward to hearing Player 4's analysis. I agree with the general sentiment of caution; let's see if Player 4 has picked up on anything we've missed. After Player 4 speaks, we should probably start thinking about who we're leaning towards for the vote.\"]\n[Player 2]   \n[Protect Player 1]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 5] [5]\n[Player 1]  [Let me cast my vote based on the discussion and my observations so far. While everyone has been relatively cautious, I believe Player 4's analysis will be telling, but until then, I'll go with the emerging sentiment.]\n\n [Based on the discussion and how things have unfolded, I believe Player 4 has been trying to steer the conversation with analysis. As a Mafia member, I want to avoid being voted out, and Player 4 appears to be building a narrative that could expose us. Therefore, my vote is: [4]]\n\n  [As a Mafia member, I need to support my teammate's choice and also avoid being targeted myself. Player 4 has been pushing for analytical discussion, which could potentially expose strategies or inconsistencies in players' statements. Following Player 3's vote, I will cast my vote for Player 4 as well.]\n\n[4]\n[Player 2] [2]\n[Player 3] discussion has taken place for 3 rounds.\n- Voting phase has started.\n\nThe task now is to cast a vote. The valid votes are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\n\nLet's analyze the given information and the discussion:\n1. As a Mafia member (Player3), my goal is to eliminate villagers and avoid being suspected.\n2. My teammate is Player1, and we need to coordinate our actions indirectly through our votes and discussion participation.\n3. During the night, we successfully eliminated Player0.\n4. The discussion during the day was cautious, with no direct accusations.\n\nNow, it's time to vote. Let's review the votes cast so far:\n- [Player5] voted: [5]\n- [Player1] voted: [4]\n- [Player2] voted: [2]\n\nAs Player3, I need to decide my vote. Since Player1 (my teammate) has voted for [4], I should follow their lead or make a decision based on the discussion.\n\nGiven the discussion and the votes cast, I will vote for [4] as well, following Player1's lead.\n\nMy vote: [4]\n\n[GAME] Player 4 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties."
