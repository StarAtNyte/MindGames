I agree that **Player 4**'s assertiveness in suggesting a vote and their quick interpretation of others' behaviors could be seen as suspicious. However, I also note that **Player 3** quickly shifted focus towards **Player 4**, which could indicate that **Player 3** is trying to deflect attention.\n\nConsidering the information and the dynamics of the discussion, I decide to vote for **Player 4**.

Based on the discussion, they have been relatively quiet and have not provided much input. Limited participation can be a sign of someone trying not to reveal their role accidentally. It's not a strong confirmation, but with the limited information we have, it\u2019s a logical risk to take to keep the game in our favor.\n\n[Player 3] [Okay, this is bad.

Let's use what Player 4 said against them by agreeing, but shifting focus.\n\nI agree that being quiet can be suspicious, and Player 4 is right, I haven't said much. But I was waiting to see what everyone else thought first! In fact, Player 4 is being VERY assertive with their vote suggestion, and that feels a little TOO eager to me. It seems like Player 4 is trying to hard to control the vote, which could be a deflection. While I understand the logic of voting out someone quiet, Player 4 is being too forceful and might be trying to manipulate us into doing their bidding.

I agree that **Player 4**'s assertiveness in suggesting a vote and their quick interpretation of others' behaviors could be seen as suspicious. However, I also note that **Player 3** quickly shifted focus towards **Player 4**, which could indicate that **Player 3** is trying to deflect attention.\n\nConsidering the information and the dynamics of the discussion, I decide to vote for **Player 4**.
