Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 2 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] [Okay, I understand. I am Player 0, a Villager, and my goal is to help eliminate the Mafia by voting during the day. Player 2 was killed last night, so we need to be extra careful. Let's start the discussion.\n\n**Round 1:**\nI'll start by saying that losing Player 2 so early is unfortunate. I'm going to listen carefully to what everyone else says and try to gauge their trustworthiness. Let's try to figure out who Player 2 suspected or who might have been acting suspiciously before they died. Does anyone have any immediate thoughts or information?]\n[Player 1]  Alright, Player 0 makes a good point. Losing Player 2 early is concerning. I didn't notice anything particularly suspicious from them, but I agree we need to be observant.\n\n**Round 1:**\n\nI'll say this: Someone seems awfully eager to immediately point fingers. Let's see who jumps in with accusations quickly. Sometimes, the most vocal accusers are trying to deflect attention from themselves. Just something to keep in mind. Let's all be calm and collected.\n[Player 5]   \n**Round 1:**  \n\nGood points from both Player 0 and Player 1. Since I was the Doctor, I did my duty last night and protected someone\u2014I won\u2019t say who yet, as it could give the Mafia an edge. But the fact that Player 2 was killed means that either they were targeted despite my protection, or I didn't protect them\u2014both of which could be telling.  \n\nI think we should closely examine anyone who seems overly interested in pushing blame or who\u2019s too quick to stay silent. I didn't hear any loud or strange behavior near my quarters last night, but I was on alert. I\u2019ll keep my observations to myself for now unless someone says something that triggers a connection.  \n\nLet\u2019s dig into Player 2\u2019s actions from before the night phase. Did they say anything unusual? Did they seem to be suspicious of someone? Or maybe they acted nervous, like they knew something?",
