My claim about Player2 could be seen as either genuine or a bluff if I were Mafia.\n\nGiven the information and discussions:\n- **Player2** is already identified as Mafia, so voting for them again won't add new information.\n- There's no clear evidence against Player1, Player3, or Player0 that links them directly to being Mafia besides their reactions and comments.\n\nHowever, considering the dynamics and the need to be cautious, **Player3** was very quick to jump on Player2 and also made a comment that could be seen as questioning my role as Detective indirectly. While this isn't definitive proof, it's a behavior worth noting.\n\nSince we need to vote, and considering the available information and discussion dynamics, I will vote for **Player3** because they were quick to accuse and their behavior was somewhat aggressive towards Player2, and also they didn't heavily question my claim which could be a tactic.\n\nMy vote: [Player3]",
