Player 2 has solidly named Player 1 as the Mafia, backed by the fact that Player 1 had suspicious nighttime activity and was seen near the village center. However, Player 1 has cast doubt on the alibi and suggested they had a neighbor.\n\nSince we still need to verify the alibi and Player 1 hasn't firmly rebutted the accusation, let's proceed with a vote to eliminate Player 1. Voting to eliminate Player 1 now can help us ensure that if they are indeed the Mafia, they won't be able to act unnoticed during the night. If they are a Villager, we can reassess the situation tomorrow.\n\n**Vote: Player 1**\n\nI will vote to eliminate Player 1. If we are correct and Player 1 is the Mafia, this will prevent them from further damaging our efforts. If they turn out to be innocent, we can reconsider our strategy in the next day phase.\n\nLet's move forward with the vote.]\n[Player 5]  Vote: Player 1\n[Player 4] [Player 4:\n\n- At this point the only alternatives to Player 1 are either Player 2 (Detective claim) or untargeted villagers.  \n- No one has stepped forward to contradict the \u201cneighbor\u201d story nor provided a counter-wagon.  \n- Player 2\u2019s risk of being counter-claimed tomorrow is too low for Mafia to take if Player 1 is actually Village.\n\nSo the safe, expected-best-ev play is to follow the Detective\u2019s check.\n\nVote: Player 1]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 4] [1]\n[Player 5]  [1]\n[Player 3] [1]\n\nThe vote to eliminate Player 1 has been cast. With Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5 agreeing to vote against Player 1, we have a majority vote. Let's proceed with voting Player 1 out.\n\n Player 1 has been eliminated. The vote count was 3 votes against Player 1 and 2 votes to keep them. They have been eliminated from the game.\n\nWith Player 1 eliminated, let's move into the Night phase. No players will have special actions during this phase. The next day phase will begin tomorrow with Player 0 as the newly eliminated player.",
