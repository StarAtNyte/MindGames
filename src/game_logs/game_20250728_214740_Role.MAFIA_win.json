Player 3's knowledge seems unusually precise, which is definitely suspicious. If they're the Detective, they should be sharing their findings, not just dropping hints. I'm starting to wonder if they're actually part of the Mafia trying to manipulate the discussion. Let's keep an eye on them and see if they reveal anything concrete.\n[Player 5]  Okay, I understand.

Accusations are flying around, which is exactly what the Mafia wants \u2013 to create chaos and mistrust.\n\nAs Detective, my priority is to find the Mafia. I need to investigate someone who is either being actively defended or is generating suspicion. Since Player 4 is actively sowing doubt about me, and Player 5 is defending me, I suspect a connection, and it's worth probing further. Plus, Player 4's accusation is getting traction, and I need to clear my name.\n\n\n[Player 1] layer 0 that your knowledge does seem suspiciously accurate. It's possible that you're just being careful with your information, but it's also possible that you're trying to manipulate the discussion.\n\nI'm not ready to accuse anyone yet, but I do think we should keep a close eye on each other. Player 4, I appreciate your analytical approach, and I think it's helpful to consider patterns and behaviors.\n\nAs we move forward, let's try to focus on the facts and avoid making assumptions. We don't want to create unnecessary tension or mislead each other.\n\nPlayer 5, thanks for sharing your role as the Doctor. That's helpful to know. Player 4, I'm glad you're being protected by Player 5.\n\nNow that we've discussed for a few rounds, I think it's time for a vote. We need to decide who to send to the night phase.

Let's break this down.\n\nYou are the Detective. Your primary task is to investigate players during the night phase. You tell the game *who* you are investigating using the format `[Player X]`. No extra text, just the player number within the brackets. You don't need to explain your reasoning or anything else during night phase.\n\nYou can discuss during the day phase, but follow the format for responses and keep in mind you are trying to identify the Mafia.  Don't get caught up in copying previous player messages.\n\n**Let's start with the Night phase. You need to choose one player to investigate.

Let's break this down.\n\nYou are the Detective. Your primary task is to investigate players during the night phase. You tell the game *who* you are investigating using the format `[Player X]`. No extra text, just the player number within the brackets. You don't need to explain your reasoning or anything else during night phase.\n\nYou can discuss during the day phase, but follow the format for responses and keep in mind you are trying to identify the Mafia.  Don't get caught up in copying previous player messages.\n\n**Let's start with the Night phase. You need to choose one player to investigate. Choose a player:**\n\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 5]  [4]\n[Player 3] \n[Player 1] [0]\n[Player 0]  [4]"
