Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 3 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 5]  I\u2019m shocked that Player\u202f3 is gone\u2026 This is the first night we\u2019ve lost a teammate. We need to be extra careful and figure out who the real threat is before the next night.\n\n From what I saw during the night, Player\u202f0 seemed a bit too quiet, and they didn\u2019t say much when the accusations started. That silence feels suspicious to me.\n\n I think we should put our trust in the majority and vote out Player\u202f1. Their behavior has been weird all day, and it\u2019s better to eliminate a possible threat before the next night.\n[Player 1] [I understand Player 5's concern about Player 3's death, and it's natural to be cautious. However, as the Detective, I have to rely on the information I gathered during the night. Last night, I investigated Player 3, and it was confirmed that they were a Mafia member. \n\nNow, I'm not convinced that Player 0's silence is necessarily suspicious. Sometimes, people can be quiet for various reasons. On the other hand, I don't think we should blindly vote out Player 1 without solid evidence. As the Detective, I'd like to investigate further before making any accusations.\n\nLet's discuss more and gather more information before deciding on a vote. Has anyone else noticed anything unusual about the other players?]\n[Player 0] let\u2019s vote Player 1.\u201d If silence really bothers you, why skip the silent person altogether and go straight for somebody who at least showed up to talk?\n\nDetective claim: thanks for coming forward with info. If your night-check on Player 3 says red, and now Mafia lost one of their own last night, that does line up. But since Doctors and Detectives are both high-value targets, we should confirm each other if possible.\n\n\u2013 While Night remained quiet, I had no good read, so I protected myself. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t chatter; the last thing a Doctor wants is to leak an obvious tell.  \n\u2013 For today I\u2019d like to hear from everyone else before we hammer. If 1 is lying, it\u2019ll collapse under cross-examination.
