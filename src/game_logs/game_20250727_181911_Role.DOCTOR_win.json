Given that Player1 and Player3 have openly admitted to being Mafia and coordinated their Night phase actions, it\u2019s logical to treat them as confirmed threats. Player3 has been the most vocal and aggressive in pushing false narratives, making them the more active threat in the discussion.\n\nPlayer4 was eliminated during the Night phase, which supports the idea that the Mafia are targeting analytical players who can contribute meaningfully to the Village\u2019s cause\u2014this validates Player4's value and confirms the Mafia\u2019s strategy to eliminate key thinkers.\n\nNow that Player4 is gone, we\u2019re in a critical 3-2 situation, and we must act decisively. I believe Player3 is the primary manipulator and should be removed immediately to prevent further control over the discussion.\n\n**Vote: Player3**]\n[Player 4] [We're on the same team, we got this. From a strategic perspective, i can't help but notice that this kill pattern shows strategic targeting. we should protect similar analytical players.. there's definitely more to this story than what we're seeing on the surface. maybe i'm overthinking it, but i wanted to mention it.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
