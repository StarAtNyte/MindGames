I\u2019m shocked about Player 0. That\u2019s devastating. I wasn\u2019t expecting that so early. I\u2019m the Doctor, and I failed to save Player 0. I chose to protect Player **3** last night. I\u2019m sharing that now because Player 2 and Player 4 are both actively investigating, and I want to provide context for what did and didn\u2019t happen during the night phase.  \n\nSince I protected Player 3 and Player 0 was killed, that means the Mafia targeted Player 0 \u2014 and Player 1 is confirmed Mafia. That means at least one other Mafia member could still be among us.  \n\nI support Player 2\u2019s and Player 4\u2019s investigations. Let\u2019s see what comes out of them so we can build a clearer picture. I\u2019d also like to ask Player 1 \u2014 since their role is revealed, are they going to play open?

I'll keep that in mind as we proceed.\n\nI've investigated Player 3, and the result is... **they are not Mafia**. That's a relief, but it also means we still have at least one more Mafia member out there.\n\nPlayer 4, you investigated Player 5; what did you find out? And Player 5, now that you've shared your action, how do you think we should proceed?\n\nAlso, Player 1 (my teammate), since your role is confirmed, perhaps you could give us some insight into our strategy or at least confirm if you're going to play openly from now on?\"\n\nLet's see how they react before making my next move.]\n[Player 2] [Okay, I understand.

The more we can clear people, the better.\n\nMy investigation of Player 5 revealed that **Player 5 is not Mafia**. It's good to know we have a Doctor on our side, and it seems they're being truthful about protecting Player 3.\n\nPlayer 1, thank you for confirming your role. Seeing as you're revealed, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give us some insight on how the remaining Mafia plan to act. Even just a little bit of misinformation would be somewhat helpful. It will allow us to gauge their strategies.\"\n\nI will now investigate **Player 3**. We know Player 5 protected them, and while that's a positive sign, I want to double-check to be absolutely sure.

With Player 0 dead and Player 1 confirmed Mafia, I should focus on figuring out how many other Mafia are left.\n\nI will use my investigations wisely. I will now use my free speech to speak, and then I will follow up with my choice of investigation.\n\n**Round 1:**\n\n\"Good morning everyone. This is a tough start with Player 0 gone. We now know Player 1 is Mafia. Has anyone else been targeted, or did anyone witness anything suspicious last night? We need to be very careful. Player 1 has already acted, so we need to try and catch the others.\"\n\nFollowing that, I will investigate a player from the list still standing: **[3]**\n[Player 4] st revealed Player 1 is Mafia! That throws a HUGE wrench into everything. We need to react carefully. Let's try to appear calm and collaborative while gathering information. Revealing your role so early is risky, but it might be effective if we can capitalize on the sudden information.\n\nHere's my response and investigation choice:\n\n**Round 1:**\n\n\"Good morning, everyone. Absolutely devastating news about Player 0. My condolences. Player 2's revelation is\u2026 significant. It changes the landscape entirely. I agree that caution is paramount, as Player 1 has already shown their hand. I want to fully support Player 2's investigation. As for what I observed, nothing particularly stood out to me last night, but I'll keep my eyes open. I'm also interested to see who Player 2 investigates and what they find. Perhaps we can compare notes.\n\nI'll also investigate **Player 5**. It feels a bit random, but it's important to cast a wide net now that we're only relatively certain about one Mafia member.\"]\n[Player 3] [I totally understand why there's some suspicion. If we think about this systematically, it's important we all work together to figure this out. what has everyone noticed so far? it seems like someone might be trying to confuse us on purpose. i'm curious if anyone else picked up on this.]\n[Player 5]   \n**Round 1:**  \n\n\"Good morning. I\u2019m shocked about Player 0. That\u2019s devastating. I wasn\u2019t expecting that so early. I\u2019m the Doctor, and I failed to save Player 0. I chose to protect Player **3** last night. I\u2019m sharing that now because Player 2 and Player 4 are both actively investigating, and I want to provide context for what did and didn\u2019t happen during the night phase.  \n\nSince I protected Player 3 and Player 0 was killed, that means the Mafia targeted Player 0 \u2014 and Player 1 is confirmed Mafia. That means at least one other Mafia member could still be among us.  \n\nI support Player 2\u2019s and Player 4\u2019s investigations. Let\u2019s see what comes out of them so we can build a clearer picture. I\u2019d also like to ask Player 1 \u2014 since their role is revealed, are they going to play open? If so, we might avoid more confusion and focus on rooting out the remaining threats.\"\n\n**End of Round 1 Statement.**\n[Player 1] [**Round 2:**\n\n\"Thank you for the responses, everyone. It's clear that we're all trying to navigate this situation carefully. Player 5, thank you for sharing that you protected me last night; that's very helpful to know. \n\nPlayer 4, your suggestion to appear calm and collaborative while gathering information is wise. I'll keep that in mind as we proceed.\n\nI've investigated Player 3, and the result is... **they are not Mafia**. That's a relief, but it also means we still have at least one more Mafia member out there.\n\nPlayer 4, you investigated Player 5; what did you find out? And Player 5, now that you've shared your action, how do you think we should proceed?\n\nAlso, Player 1 (my teammate), since your role is confirmed, perhaps you could give us some insight into our strategy or at least confirm if you're going to play openly from now on?\"\n\n[Player 2] [Okay, I understand. Here's my response for Round 2, and the investigation choice.\n\n**Round 2:**\n\n\"Excellent work, Detective. Your confirmation that Player 3 is not Mafia is important, and it narrows down our possibilities. I agree with Player 4, being calm and collaborative is the best approach.\n\nPlayer 5, thank you for sharing your role as Doctor and your action of protecting Player 3. That provides us with critical information, and I also agree that revealing your role was a wise move\u2014although I'm sorry you were unable to save Player 0.\n\nPlayer 4, I am eager to hear the results of your investigation of Player 5.\n\nPlayer 1, since you are confirmed mafia, I'd appreciate it if you told us if you plan to be more open in this or if you will continue to play passively. It could help.\"\n\nI will now investigate **Player 4**.]\n[Player 4] * Protected by Doctor (Player 5)\n*   **Player 4:** Villager (me) - Investigated Player 5.\n*   **Player 5:** Doctor - Protected Player 3.\n\n\n**Round 2:**\n\n\"Thanks, Player 2, that's great news about Player 3! The more we can clear people, the better.\n\nMy investigation of Player 5 revealed that **Player 5 is not Mafia**. It's good to know we have a Doctor on our side, and it seems they're being truthful about protecting Player 3.\n\nPlayer 1, thank you for confirming your role. Seeing as you're revealed, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give us some insight on how the remaining Mafia plan to act. Even just a little bit of misinformation would be somewhat helpful. It will allow us to gauge their strategies.\"\n\nI will now investigate **Player 3**. We know Player 5 protected them, and while that's a positive sign, I want to double-check to be absolutely sure. Let's solidify our information and target anyone who looks potentially suspicious.]\n[Player 3] [Let's break this down logically. The logical conclusion is, we need to focus on players who are asking lots of questions but not providing their own analysis. that's a mafia tell. i'm curious to hear what others noticed during the discussions. am i reading too much into this, or do others agree?]\n[Player 5] s killed, and since I protected Player 3 last night, that means Player 0 was the Mafia\u2019s target \u2014 and my protection worked.\n\nPlayer 2 investigated Player 3 and found they\u2019re clear. Then Player 4 confirmed that by investigating me and finding I\u2019m also clear. Then Player 4 went on to investigate Player 2 and found they\u2019re not Mafia either. Now Player 4 is re-checking Player 3, which is smart for reinforcement.\n\nSomething to consider: we need to be careful about how we interpret Player 1\u2019s openness. If they\u2019re willingly revealing information or playing collaboratively, that might help us triangulate who\u2019s still hiding something.\n\nRight now, the only confirmed Mafia is Player 1, and the remaining players are: me (Player 5), Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4. All of us have been cleared by investigations except Player 4, who\u2019s currently being investigated now.\n\n\n**End of Round 2 Statement.**]\n[Player 1]  not to be Mafia (or have roles that are beneficial to the village), and considering Player 3 is cleared and my teammate, the logical target would be someone who hasn't been investigated or has raised suspicion.\n\n## 5: Consider the investigations and roles.\nPlayer 2 (Detective) has been very active and has investigated others, providing valuable information. Player 4 has also been investigating and seems to be gathering information efficiently. Player 5 (Doctor) has protected players and seems trustworthy.\n\nSince my teammate (Player 3) is cleared and we know the Doctor (Player 5) and their action, targeting a player who can significantly impact the game's balance is crucial. Player 2, being the Detective, poses a significant threat if they continue to investigate and reveal Mafia members.\n\n## 7: Night action.\nConsidering the strategic advantage, I will target Player 2 for elimination during the night.\n\n\n[Player 2]  Since I am a known Mafia member, I will target Player 2 at night.\n[Player 4] [to be part of multiple appeals.\"\"\"]\n[Player 3] [I appreciate you bringing this up. Player 2 claims to be Detective, but their 'investigation' results seem too convenient. Real Detectives are more cautious. Let's focus on the facts we can observe rather than just guessing. Let me know if you've noticed similar patterns.]\n[Player 5]  Phase:**  \n  \n\n**Day Phase - Round 3:**  \n\n\"Good morning. I just protected Player 2 during the night phase based on the strategic risk assessment and the fact that they're the Detective \u2014 a key role that the Mafia would want to eliminate.  \n\nSince Player 1 openly confirmed their Mafia role and targeted Player 2, it confirms their strategy to eliminate investigative roles.  \n\nI urge everyone to keep calm and focus on the roles we have confirmed:  \n- Player 1 is Mafia (confirmed)  \n- Player 5 is Doctor  \n- Player 2 is Detective  \n- Player 3 and Player 4 are cleared by investigations  \n\nWe now need to make a decision on who to vote out today. Since Player 1 is already confirmed Mafia, we should vote them out to reduce the threat.  \n\nHowever, if anyone else raises concern or there's a reason to suspect someone else, let\u2019s coordinate quickly before the vote.\"  \n\n**Final Vote Will Begin Now**  \nPlease choose one player to eliminate: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  \nI vote for: \n[Player 1] en providing crucial information. Player5, as the Doctor, has been protecting villagers. Player3 and Player4 are cleared and seem to be working together to uncover the truth.\n\n## 3: Consider the actions and investigations done so far.\nPlayer2 investigated Player3 and found them clear. Player4 investigated Player5 and found them clear, then investigated Player2 and found them not to be Mafia. Player5 protected Player3 and then Player2.\n\n## 4: Evaluate the threat level of each player.\nPlayer1 is a confirmed threat. Player2, being the Detective, could become a significant threat if they continue to investigate. However, their role and actions seem transparent and helpful to the village.\n\n## 5: Decide on the vote based on the information and strategic advantage.\nGiven that Player1 is a confirmed Mafia member and has been openly playing their role, and considering the strategic advantage of removing a known threat, the logical choice for the vote would be Player1.\n\n[1]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 2] [1]\n[Player 1] information, and considering that my teammate Player 3 is cleared, the logical target would be Player 2 to eliminate the Detective role.\n\n## 4: Consider the impact of the Doctor's protection.\nPlayer 5 protected Player 2, which means Player 2 is safe for now. This protection indicates that Player 5 is actively working to save villagers, specifically targeting Player 2 after they were chosen as a night action target.\n\n## 5: Decide on the night action based on strategic advantage.\nThe night action is to target Player 2. However, since Player 5 protected them, the action will not be successful.\n\n## 6: Evaluate the day phase voting.\nDuring the day, players discuss and vote. Given that Player 1 is a confirmed Mafia and has been openly playing, and considering the strategic advantage of removing a known threat, the logical choice for the vote would be Player 1.\n\n## 7: Submit the vote.\nBased on the information and strategic advantage, the vote should be for Player 1.\n\n[1]\n[Player 5] [1]\n[GAME] Player 3 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties."
