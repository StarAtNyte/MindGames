However, Player 4 also exhibited defensive behavior early on, which could indicate either guilt or fear of being targeted. Given Player 1\u2019s sudden absence, it\u2019s crucial we don\u2019t overlook anyone. Let\u2019s continue observing and sharing our findings.]\n[Player 0]  that train. Player 4, same concern: while defending yourself isn\u2019t town-confessory, the me-then-not-me wording in your post (\u201chowever, Player 4\u2026\u201d) feels odd\u2014like you\u2019re narrating yourself in the third person. Player 3, your logic on low-posters is reasonable but it\u2019s still just process-of-elimination.\n\n[Round 3]  \nHere\u2019s my early sorting:  \n- Least likely Mafia at the moment: Player 3\u2014his posts contain the deepest reasoning and invite more discussion rather than shutting it down.  \n- Middle pile: Player 4 (the self-defensive posture could go either way) and Player 5 (we haven\u2019t heard from them yet).  \n- Watching: Player 2\u2014unclear herding vote; and, yes, myself\u2014though I promise any silence stemmed from caution, not scum cover.  \n\nNext step: I\u2019d like to hear Player 0 (me) talk more obviously (doing now), Player 5 speak for the first time today, and some explanation from Player 2 about what her \u201c[0]\u201d was meant to signal beyond blank shade. After that, we can lock in our vote more safely.\n[Player 5] Okay, I understand the situation. Day phase. I need to contribute to the discussion and vote strategically.\n\n**Round 1**\n\nI was observing the discussions yesterday, trying to gauge everyone's behavior. The way players reacted to Player 1's death will be critical. My main focus is to avoid suspicion and blend in.\n\n**Round 2**\n\nI haven't had time to formulate a comprehensive read on everyone's actions. I noted Player 0's silence and Player 2's focus on voting which could be seen as unusual. Player 3's analysis seems fair, and Player 4 seems defensive.\n\n**Round 3**\n\nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 0's silence and Player 4's defensiveness. Player 2's early comment on Player 0 without context seems suspicious, and I'd like to hear more from her. I also want to understand her reasoning.\n\nGiven the limited information, I'm leaning toward voting for **Player 2** . I found their initial comment a little too decisive without sufficient evidence.\n\nMy vote:  ****\n[Player 3] [My vote: Player 2]\n[Player 2] [0]",
