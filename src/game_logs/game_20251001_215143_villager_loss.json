Their quiet demeanor and reluctance to engage in the discussion has been a red flag. However, I also believe that Player 5's overprotection of their teammates is concerning. It\u2019s important to consider the entire picture, but let's not discount the behavior of Player 2 either.\n\nI'll vote on Player 2.

However, maybe Player 2 is just observing and trying to get a read on everyone before speaking up. Jumping to conclusions based on silence might be a mistake.

I\u2019ve got a solid lead: **Player 0 is definitely not a Mafia member**\u2014confirmed by the night report. That leaves us with the other five, and I\u2019ve noticed that **Player 2 has been unusually quiet** compared to the rest of us.

Their silence could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention, which is common among Mafia members trying to blend in. Additionally, their lack of engagement might indicate they're observing and planning rather than participating openly.]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand. We're in the second round of discussion after a tied vote yesterday.\n\nI've been targeted along with Player 1, but the votes were tied. Player 4 is suggesting Player 2 is suspicious because of their silence, and now Player 1 agrees. I think it's important to consider everyone's perspective.\n\nI will put my vote on Player 2 to see if others agree to vote on them.\n\nLet's vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I understand. Player 4 and Player 1 are pushing hard on Player 2. As Mafia, Player 2 is my teammate! I need to defend Player 2 without making it obvious I'm protecting them. I also need to appear cooperative to avoid suspicion.\n\n I see what Player 4 and Player 1 are saying about Player 2 being quiet. However, maybe Player 2 is just observing and trying to get a read on everyone before speaking up. Jumping to conclusions based on silence might be a mistake. It's important to consider that not everyone is comfortable speaking up immediately, especially in a stressful situation like this. Let's not rush to judgement and consider other possibilities. I'm not convinced yet.\n[Player 2]  4] [I agree with Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious.

Let's finalize our decision on Player 1 and Player 3 based on the evidence we have.]\n\n [Confirmed. Let's have the final vote on Player 1 and Player 3.]\n\n**Final Vote Summary:**\n- **Player 1 - 4 votes**\n- **Player 3 - 4 votes**\n\nThe votes are still tied, so we'll need a tie-breaking procedure. According to the game rules, in the event of a tie, the Doctor (Player 0) gets the final say.\n\n**Player 0** [Considering the information and the roles involved, I will cast my final vote on Player 3, as their behavior and the lack of active participation have raised more suspicion compared to Player 1.]\n\n**Final Vote Summary (After Player 0's say):**\n- **Player 3 - 5 votes**\n\nPlayer 3 has been identified for elimination.\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now know for sure that **Player 0 is not a Mafia member**\u2014the night report confirmed that.

Additionally, their recent shift in behavior stands out compared to their usual contributions.]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand. We're in the third round of discussion and based on the information, I will vote for Player 2.\n\nPlayer 2's silence and lack of participation are suspicious since they've been targeted as a potential suspect. I will put my vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I need to play this carefully. Player 4 and Player 1 are very suspicious of Player 2. I need to try and deflect attention from Player 2 without making myself suspicious. I need a new target. I will act like I am agreeing with them but shift the vote.\n\n I see what both Player 4 and Player 1 are saying about Player 2. However, I think Player 4 is trying *too hard* to push the suspicion onto Player 2. While it's true that being quiet can be suspicious, it can also be a strategy to observe before acting. Perhaps we should be looking at who is pushing the hardest for a particular vote, and trying to direct the conversation. I'm not saying Player 4 is Mafia, but their insistence on Player 2 is making me uncomfortable. I'm going to vote for Player 4 this round.\n[Player 2] eir overprotection of their teammates. Their behavior is very off compared to how they have been in previous rounds. I will put my vote on Player 5.\n [Player 2 is acting very suspiciously. I think they are trying to hide something and are not being truthful. I will put my vote on Player 2.\n [Player 2's change of vote is concerning. While it's true that Player 2 has been quiet, it's also possible that they are just cautious and prefer to gather more information before making a decision. Let's focus on the evidence and behavior of all players, not just the ones who have been vocal.\n\nI will still vote on Player 2, but I will also mention that Player 5 has been very protective of their teammates. Let's not jump to conclusions about Player 5's motives without more evidence.\n\nYour response:  I understand what you're saying. However, I think Player 2's change of vote is suspicious. They have been acting very quiet and withdrawn, and their sudden shift in behavior\n[Player 0] [**Player 3**: I agree that Player 2's change of vote is suspicious. Their quiet demeanor and reluctance to engage in the discussion has been a red flag. However, I also believe that Player 5's overprotection of their teammates is concerning. It\u2019s important to consider the entire picture, but let's not discount the behavior of Player 2 either.\n\nI'll vote on Player 2. While I think Player 5's overprotection is odd, I need to make sure I am not also veering into suspicion where there isn\u2019t clear evidence yet.\n\n**Vote Summary:**\n- **Player 2 - 4 votes**\n- **Player 5 - 3 votes**\n\nLet\u2019s move forward with the vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now know for sure that **Player 0 is not a Mafia member**\u2014the night report confirmed that.

We're in another round of discussion, and the focus is still on Player 2, with Player 4 and Player 1 leading the charge. The votes seem to be converging again. I think it would be best to place my vote on Player 2 to help eliminate the possible mafioso.\n\nI will vote for Player 2.]\n[Player 5]  voted for Player 2 as well.\n*   I tried throwing suspicion onto Player 4 last round, but it didn't work and I almost immediately got a vote on me.\n*   With so much suspicion piled on Player 2, it's unlikely I can save them.\n*   If Player 2 is eliminated and I continue to defend them, I will immediately become the primary suspect.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to throw Player 2 under the bus and vote for them. It sucks, but it's necessary for my survival. I will act as if I am reluctantly agreeing.\nThis way, I can survive to night time, and then take out Player 0 to get back into a lead again, using vote '' to secure night time victory.\n\n Okay, I have been thinking about this, and I have to reluctantly agree with Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, and now Player 0. Player 2 HAS been very quiet, and given everything that has transpired, I have to vote with the majority. I don't like it, but it seems like the only reasonable thing to do.

The best way to do this is to push the vote onto Player 4.\n\n I agree with Player 4's assessment that Player 2 has been quiet. It's suspicious. However, Player 4 has ALWAYS been suspicious of Player 2, even to the point where I started to think Player 4 was trying *too* hard to push the vote on Player 2. Now that Player 2 is gone, Player 4 is still pushing this line of reasoning. I find this very suspicious. It seems that Player 4 needs a target, and is just defaulting to their old strategy.\n\nI think we should give Player 4 the vote this round. If Player 4 is a villager, then we'll know, and we can move on. But if Player 4 is Mafia... then we might catch them. I am voting for Player 4.\n[Player 0] analysis.

I'm going to make it look like a big risky gambit, but really I don't care.\n\n I agree with Player 4 in some sense, but I can see what Player 1 and Player 0 are saying. Now, with Player 3 already gone, it stands to reason Player 4 and Player 1 are trying to get Player 2 out fast. Could they be trying to knock a Mafioso out immediately? Or are they being genuine? Now that all the cards have been revealed here, I am going to throw everyone for a loop and say GO AHEAD AND VOTE ME NEXT ROUND. I want to see what my vote number looks like with a target on my back.

Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] :** \"Let me follow the Doctor's lead for now. I agree with keeping Player 2 and Player 4 safe until we gather more information.\"\n\n**Vote:**\nAfter the discussion, it's time to vote on whom to eliminate based on suspicion and behavior:\n- **Player 0 (Doctor):** \"Based on today's discussion, I propose we vote on Player 1 and Player 3 for tonight's vote.\"\n- **Player 1:** (Skeptical but following the flow) \"I agree, Player 0. These players have shown some suspicious signs.\"\n- **Player 2:** \"I support the Doctor's suggestion. Let's take a vote on Player 1 and Player 3.\"\n- **Player 3:** \"It seems justifiable. I agree.\"\n- **Player 4:** \"Agreed. Player 1 and Player 3 are fair choices.\"\n- **Player 5:** \"Yes, let's vote on Player 1 and Player 3.\"\n\n**Final Vote Summary:**\n- **Player 1 - 4 votes**\n- **Player 3 - 4 votes**\n\nThe votes are tied, and we will need another round of discussion for a final decision or to implement a tie-breaking vote procedure if that option is available in the game rules.]\n[Player 4] [Everyone, let\u2019s keep the conversation flowing. I\u2019ve got a solid lead: **Player 0 is definitely not a Mafia member**\u2014confirmed by the night report. That leaves us with the other five, and I\u2019ve noticed that **Player 2 has been unusually quiet** compared to the rest of us. Silence can be a sign of trying to stay under the radar, so I\u2019ll put my vote on **Player 2**\u2014quiet players often hide the most. What did you all see or hear last night? Any odd timing, nervous glances, or sudden shifts in tone?]\n[Player 1] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they've been unusually quiet and haven't contributed much to our discussions. Their silence could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention, which is common among Mafia members trying to blend in. Additionally, their lack of engagement might indicate they're observing and planning rather than participating openly.]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand. We're in the second round of discussion after a tied vote yesterday.\n\nI've been targeted along with Player 1, but the votes were tied. Player 4 is suggesting Player 2 is suspicious because of their silence, and now Player 1 agrees. I think it's important to consider everyone's perspective.\n\nI will put my vote on Player 2 to see if others agree to vote on them.\n\nLet's vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I understand. Player 4 and Player 1 are pushing hard on Player 2. As Mafia, Player 2 is my teammate! I need to defend Player 2 without making it obvious I'm protecting them. I also need to appear cooperative to avoid suspicion.\n\n I see what Player 4 and Player 1 are saying about Player 2 being quiet. However, maybe Player 2 is just observing and trying to get a read on everyone before speaking up. Jumping to conclusions based on silence might be a mistake. It's important to consider that not everyone is comfortable speaking up immediately, especially in a stressful situation like this. Let's not rush to judgement and consider other possibilities. I'm not convinced yet.\n[Player 2]  4] [I agree with Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious. I think they're hiding something.\n\nLet's vote on Player 3.]\n [I agree with Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious. I think they're hiding something.\n\nLet's vote on Player 3.]\n [I agree with Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious. I think they're hiding something.\n\nLet's vote on Player 3.]\n [I agree with Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 5. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious. I think they're hiding something.\n\nLet's vote on Player 3.]\n [I agree with Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 2. I think Player 3 is guilty and their behavior is suspicious. I think they're hiding something.\n\nLet's vote on Player 3.]\n[Player\n[Player 0] et, and their behavior could be indicative of Mafia members. Let's have a final vote on them.]\n\n [After reconsideration, I agree with the initial proposal. Player 1 and Player 3 have shown signs of suspicious behavior. I will vote on them.]\n\n [Agreed. Let's finalize our decision on Player 1 and Player 3 based on the evidence we have.]\n\n [Confirmed. Let's have the final vote on Player 1 and Player 3.]\n\n**Final Vote Summary:**\n- **Player 1 - 4 votes**\n- **Player 3 - 4 votes**\n\nThe votes are still tied, so we'll need a tie-breaking procedure. According to the game rules, in the event of a tie, the Doctor (Player 0) gets the final say.\n\n**Player 0** [Considering the information and the roles involved, I will cast my final vote on Player 3, as their behavior and the lack of active participation have raised more suspicion compared to Player 1.]\n\n**Final Vote Summary (After Player 0's say):**\n- **Player 3 - 5 votes**\n\nPlayer 3 has been identified for elimination.\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now know for sure that **Player 0 is not a Mafia member**\u2014the night report confirmed that. Since no one was killed, the Mafia\u2019s target must have been protected by the Doctor, which means the Mafia is still out there among us. I\u2019ve been watching the conversation and notice that **Player 2 has been unusually quiet** compared to the rest of us. Silence can be a sign of trying to stay under the radar, so I\u2019ll put my vote on **Player 2**\u2014quiet players often hide the most. What did you all see or hear last night? Any odd timing, nervous glances, or sudden shifts in tone? Let\u2019s hear your thoughts.]\n[Player 1] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they've been deflecting attention and avoiding direct answers. Their silence and reluctance to engage could be a tactic to avoid drawing suspicion onto themselves, which is common among Mafia members trying to blend in. Additionally, their recent shift in behavior stands out compared to their usual contributions.]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand. We're in the third round of discussion and based on the information, I will vote for Player 2.\n\nPlayer 2's silence and lack of participation are suspicious since they've been targeted as a potential suspect. I will put my vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I need to play this carefully. Player 4 and Player 1 are very suspicious of Player 2. I need to try and deflect attention from Player 2 without making myself suspicious. I need a new target. I will act like I am agreeing with them but shift the vote.\n\n I see what both Player 4 and Player 1 are saying about Player 2. However, I think Player 4 is trying *too hard* to push the suspicion onto Player 2. While it's true that being quiet can be suspicious, it can also be a strategy to observe before acting. Perhaps we should be looking at who is pushing the hardest for a particular vote, and trying to direct the conversation. I'm not saying Player 4 is Mafia, but their insistence on Player 2 is making me uncomfortable. I'm going to vote for Player 4 this round.\n[Player 2] eir overprotection of their teammates. Their behavior is very off compared to how they have been in previous rounds. I will put my vote on Player 5.\n [Player 2 is acting very suspiciously. I think they are trying to hide something and are not being truthful. I will put my vote on Player 2.\n [Player 2's change of vote is concerning. While it's true that Player 2 has been quiet, it's also possible that they are just cautious and prefer to gather more information before making a decision. Let's focus on the evidence and behavior of all players, not just the ones who have been vocal.\n\nI will still vote on Player 2, but I will also mention that Player 5 has been very protective of their teammates. Let's not jump to conclusions about Player 5's motives without more evidence.\n\nYour response:  I understand what you're saying. However, I think Player 2's change of vote is suspicious. They have been acting very quiet and withdrawn, and their sudden shift in behavior\n[Player 0] [**Player 3**: I agree that Player 2's change of vote is suspicious. Their quiet demeanor and reluctance to engage in the discussion has been a red flag. However, I also believe that Player 5's overprotection of their teammates is concerning. It\u2019s important to consider the entire picture, but let's not discount the behavior of Player 2 either.\n\nI'll vote on Player 2. While I think Player 5's overprotection is odd, I need to make sure I am not also veering into suspicion where there isn\u2019t clear evidence yet.\n\n**Vote Summary:**\n- **Player 2 - 4 votes**\n- **Player 5 - 3 votes**\n\nLet\u2019s move forward with the vote on Player 2.]\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now know for sure that **Player 0 is not a Mafia member**\u2014the night report confirmed that.

Any odd timing, nervous glances, or sudden shifts in tone? Let\u2019s hear your thoughts.]\n[Player 1] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they've been extremely quiet and have avoided contributing to the discussion. Their silence could be a tactic to avoid drawing attention, which is common among Mafia members trying to blend in. Additionally, their recent shift in behavior stands out compared to their usual contributions, indicating they might be observing and planning rather than participating openly.]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand the situation. We're in another round of discussion, and the focus is still on Player 2, with Player 4 and Player 1 leading the charge. The votes seem to be converging again. I think it would be best to place my vote on Player 2 to help eliminate the possible mafioso.\n\nI will vote for Player 2.]\n[Player 5]  voted for Player 2 as well.\n*   I tried throwing suspicion onto Player 4 last round, but it didn't work and I almost immediately got a vote on me.\n*   With so much suspicion piled on Player 2, it's unlikely I can save them.\n*   If Player 2 is eliminated and I continue to defend them, I will immediately become the primary suspect.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to throw Player 2 under the bus and vote for them. It sucks, but it's necessary for my survival. I will act as if I am reluctantly agreeing.\nThis way, I can survive to night time, and then take out Player 0 to get back into a lead again, using vote '' to secure night time victory.\n\n Okay, I have been thinking about this, and I have to reluctantly agree with Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, and now Player 0. Player 2 HAS been very quiet, and given everything that has transpired, I have to vote with the majority. I don't like it, but it seems like the only reasonable thing to do. I'm voting for Player 2.\n[Player 2] unusually quiet** compared to the rest of us. Silence can be a sign of trying to stay under the radar, so I\u2019ll put my vote on **Player 2**\u2014quiet players often hide the most. What did you all see or hear last night?

Their behavior has been peculiar and could indicate they are hiding something.\n\n**Final Vote:**\n- **Player 1 - 4 votes**\n\nPlayer 1 has been eliminated.\n\n**Night phase - choose one player to protect:**\n[1], [2], [4], [5]\n\nI will protect Player 2.\n\nReasoning:\n- Protecting Player 2 ensures that another key player is kept safe.\n- Player 2\u2019s quiet demeanor has raised suspicion, but there isn\u2019t enough concrete evidence to eliminate them yet. Keeping them safe aligns with the strategy to build more evidence against players before eliminating them.\n\nPlease confirm the protection if no further steps are needed.\n No one was killed tonight.\n Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now have a clear picture: **Player 0 and Player 1 are confirmed innocent**, and **Player 3 was voted out last night**, leaving us with Players 2, 4, and 5 as the remaining suspects. No one was killed, so the Mafia\u2019s target was protected by the Doctor, meaning they\u2019re still out there.

I need to be more careful.\n\nNew strategy: Now that Player 3 and Player 2 are eliminated, the villagers think Player 0 and Player 1 are innocent. The remaining players are Player 4 and Player 5 (myself). The key to winning is eliminating the remaining villager.\n\nI need to look like a villager. The best way to do this is to push the vote onto Player 4.\n\n I agree with Player 4's assessment that Player 2 has been quiet. It's suspicious. However, Player 4 has ALWAYS been suspicious of Player 2, even to the point where I started to think Player 4 was trying *too* hard to push the vote on Player 2. Now that Player 2 is gone, Player 4 is still pushing this line of reasoning. I find this very suspicious. It seems that Player 4 needs a target, and is just defaulting to their old strategy.\n\nI think we should give Player 4 the vote this round. If Player 4 is a villager, then we'll know, and we can move on. But if Player 4 is Mafia... then we might catch them. I am voting for Player 4.\n[Player 0] analysis. Player 2\u2019s silence is suspicious, and we should continue to monitor their behavior. Let\u2019s see if this pattern continues and gather more evidence.\n\n****\nI agree with the analysis. Player 2\u2019s behavior is still suspicious, but we need to gather more evidence before making a final decision. I will continue to watch their behavior and monitor any changes.\n\n### Final Vote Summary:\n- **Player 2 - 5 votes**\n\nPlayer 2 has been identified for elimination.\n\n****\nPlayer 2 has been identified for elimination. The next step is to protect a player during the night phase.\n\n** Night phase - choose one player to protect: [1], [4], [5]**\n- ** I will protect Player 5.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Protecting Player 5 ensures that another key player is kept safe from potential Mafia elimination.\n- Player 5 has shown some suspicious behavior but has not been targeted yet, making them a safer choice this round.\n\nPlease confirm the protection if no further steps are needed.\n[Player 4] [Fellow townsfolk, we now have a clear picture: **Player 0 and Player 1 are confirmed innocent**, and **Player 3 was voted out last night**, leaving us with Players 2, 4, and 5 as the remaining suspects.

This means my strategy is to try a 180 and throw SUSPICION on Player 5 in order to lower my threat level. I will publicly ask for people to vote on me next round so the attention will come back on me, and not on Player 0 or the doctor. I'm going to make it look like a big risky gambit, but really I don't care.\n\n I agree with Player 4 in some sense, but I can see what Player 1 and Player 0 are saying. Now, with Player 3 already gone, it stands to reason Player 4 and Player 1 are trying to get Player 2 out fast. Could they be trying to knock a Mafioso out immediately? Or are they being genuine? Now that all the cards have been revealed here, I am going to throw everyone for a loop and say GO AHEAD AND VOTE ME NEXT ROUND. I want to see what my vote number looks like with a target on my back. So consider me in this odd, wild dance. I find it odd that they are so determined, if not to put a light on Player 2, but to cause such an attention for a single man.\n\n[4]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

I voted to eliminate Player 0 last night as the Mafia, but Player 0 protected Player 1.\n\nNow Player 0 is dead, and the remaining players are Player 1, Player 4, and myself. We just had the voting day summary come through, and it seems I was too late to vote.\n\nThat means that player four is voted again. The next day cycle will continue\n\nBecause both the players are innocent, That means Player 4 will be voted off today cycle.\n\n Now the voting phase has started, and the only valid votes are on Player 1, Player 4 and now Player 5.\nI am going to put the vote for Player 4 in order to secure my nighttime win\n\n[4]\n[Player 4] \n[GAME] Player 1 attempted an invalid move.
