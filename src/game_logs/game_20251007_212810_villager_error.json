      "content": "\n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 0.\nYour role: Villager\nTeam: Village\nDescription: A regular villager. Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 3 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI'm Player 1, a Villager. Since Player 3 was killed during the night, we need to figure out who the Mafia might be. I think we should start by questioning who had the most suspicious behavior last night or during previous discussions. Let's keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Who do you all think might be the Mafia?\n[Player 5]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI‚Äôm Player 5. Agreed we shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions, but we also can‚Äôt afford a no-lynch with 5 alive‚Äîparity tomorrow would likely end the game. The N1 kill on 3 is low-info; I wouldn‚Äôt overread it.\n\nLet‚Äôs be structured:\n- Players 0, 2, 4: who‚Äôs your top suspect right now and one concrete reason?\n- Does anyone have hard info? If a Detective has a solid red, that‚Äôs worth sharing. Otherwise, I‚Äôd avoid premature role reveals; Doctor should stay quiet.\n\nPlayer 1‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Villager‚Äù claim is NAI to me. I‚Äôll hold my vote until we hear from 0, 2, and 4.\n[Player 4] [DAY 1 - ROUND 2] I'm Player 4, the Detective. Last night, I investigated Player 2 and found out that they are indeed a Mafia member. I think it's worth sharing this information now to help us make a more informed decision. Given that Player 2 is Mafia, we should be cautious around them. Player 2's actions and statements should be scrutinized, and we should consider their potential influence on the game. I agree with Player 5's structured approach and will state my top suspect and reason. However, since I've already investigated Player 2 and they are Mafia, my next step is to look for other potential Mafia members. My top suspect right now, based on the available information and the fact that Player 3 was killed, would be Player 0, simply because we don't have much information about them yet, and the kill on Player 3 doesn't directly point to a specific Mafia member aside from Player 2. I'd like to hear from Player 0 and Player 2 as per Player 5's suggestion.\n[Player 2] [Alright, folks, another night gone with Player 3‚Äôs departure‚Äîtragic, but it‚Äôs a golden opportunity to shine! Let‚Äôs hear what everyone‚Äôs been up to. I‚Äôm especially curious about Player 0‚Äôs sudden shift from quiet to accusing the night after the kill. That kind of ‚ÄúI‚Äëknow‚Äëeverything‚Äù vibe feels a bit too smooth for a fresh villager. As for voting, I‚Äôll put my vote on Player 0‚ÄîI think the most suspicious one is the one who‚Äôs trying to be the detective without any proof. Let‚Äôs keep the laughs going while we dig deeper! ü§î]",
