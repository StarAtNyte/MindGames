      "Turn 3: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 2.\nYour role: Villager\nDescription: A regular villager. Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 3 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Let me break down what I've observed so far and share my analysis.]\n[Player 4]  Ah, great, let's get down to business. From what I know, Player 0 is not a Mafia member, which is a good starting point. Also, I investigated Player 0 last night, so I can rule them out. Unfortunately, Player 3 was taken out during the night, which means we lost some potential information.\n\nI'm still trying to process everything, but one thing that stands out to me is that we don't have much information about the other players yet. I'd like to hear from others - what do you guys think happened to Player 3? And more importantly, who do we think might be Mafia?\n\nI'm not ready to point fingers yet, but I do think we should discuss and gather more information before we vote. Who's got some insights to share?\n[Player 1] s you can share would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n Sure, let's continue. I don't have any new observations beyond what I've mentioned. However, since Player 3 is out, and we have two players left (Player 2 and Player 4) who we are questioning, it would be wise to be cautious. Player 4, you mentioned no suspicious behavior from Player 1 and Player 5. Can you elaborate on why you believe they weren't acting suspiciously last night? Any specific moments or behaviors you noticed?\n\n---\n\n I observed that Player 1 and Player 5 communicated clearly and without any unusual behavior. They didn\u2019t try to mask their intentions or behavior, which is somewhat expected from the Mafia, as they would want to keep their actions secret. Their consistency in agreeing on the target (Player 3) and the straightforwardness of their communication could suggest a lack of suspicious behavior. We need more information, but let\u2019s continue from here and carefully consider everyone\u2019s actions moving forward.\n[Player 0] \n[Player 5] yer4 has done some investigation and has some insights to share.
