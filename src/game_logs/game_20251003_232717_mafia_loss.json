Otherwise, I see no reason to look elsewhere.\n[Player 3] layer 2 claims to have investigated me and outed me as Mafia. Player 5 already expressed suspicion towards me. My best strategy is to try and create doubt about Player 2's claim. I need to appear cooperative and innocent while deflecting the suspicion onto someone else.\n\n Player 2, that's a serious accusation. It's very early in the game to be making such claims. Could you tell us more about your role and how your investigation works? What made you choose to investigate me specifically?\n\nTo be honest, I was just trying to comment on the flow of the voting and ensure we're all on the same page today and also to avoid friendly fire, perhaps I was just being a bit too enthusiastic. I'm just a villager trying to contribute.\n\nAlso, Player 5's comment about my wording is interesting, but can easily be misinterpreted. Perhaps Player 5 is trying to divert attention from themselves. What about we focus on Player 5 first and see how he would respond if he is a villager? Let's test him.\n[Player 1] [Player 2's accusation against Player 3 seems sudden. Player 3's defensive response about creating doubt might be a red herring. I'd focus on Player 2's investigation claim during the vote.]\n[Player 5] ayer 3's comment about \"my teammate,\" it seems prudent to investigate Player 3's claims further during the vote.\n\nI propose that we vote on Player 3 today, as the suspicion against them is substantial, and it's crucial to eliminate potential Mafia members early. If Player 2 is telling the truth about their role and investigation, voting out Player 3 would be a significant step towards winning the game for the Village.\n\nMy vote will be based on the discussion and the credibility of the information presented. I will wait for the final round of discussion before casting my vote.\n\nFor now, I'll reiterate that we should focus on verifying Player 2's claim and understanding their role. If Player 2 is genuine, their information is invaluable. Let's use the next round of discussion to clarify any doubts and then decide on our vote.\n\n**To vote, I will follow the game's instruction and provide my vote at the end of the third round of discussion.**\n\nLet's proceed to the next round of discussion.]\n[Player 4] [0]\n[Player 2]   \nI\u2019m the **Detective**\u2014last night I investigated Player 3 and the game told me \u201cPlayer 3 IS a Mafia member.\u201d That\u2019s a binary result; there\u2019s no ambiguity.  \n\nPlayer 3\u2019s reply essentially admits the slip (\u201cmy teammate has already voted\u2026\u201d) and now tries to pivot onto Player 5. Classic Mafia deflection.  \n\nWe have two choices:  \n1. Trust the hard investigative result and lynch Player 3 today.  \n2. Let Player 3 live, lose our only confirmed lead, and give the Mafia another free night-kill.  \n\nI\u2019ll be voting **Player 3** at the end of this round. If anyone still doubts me, remember that when Player 3 flips Mafia it will also clear me as the real Detective, giving the Village a perfect roadmap for tomorrow.\n[Player 3] Okay, the situation is dire. Player 2 has outed me as Mafia with what seems like a credible claim. Player 5 is suspicious, and Player 1 isn't buying my deflection. My only hope is to create enough chaos and doubt to survive this round. I need to hard push back on Player 2 and try to make them look like they're lying or mistaken.\n\nPlayer 2 claims to be the Detective. My goal is to make others doubtful. I will aggressively question them to make them nervous.\n\nPlayer 2, if you are the detective, then you must be lying. It is more likely that the mafia would try to falsely claim roles and you are a sneaky accomplice. Can you provide evidence of this?\n\nFor example, who have YOU worked for previously? Do you have ties with Player 5? Why are you claiming that I am the Mafia, and not someone else? As an investigator, you should investigate more people.\n\nI accuse Player 2 as the MAFIA as well. By throwing me under the bus as a fake investigation/role claim!\n\nI vote:\n\n[Player 1] [Player 3's defensive claims and Player 2's sudden accusation feel forced. I'm more concerned about Player 2's abrupt investigation claim than Player 3's deflections.]\n[Player 5] Player 2's claim of being the Detective and investigating Player 3 seems credible, especially since they provided a clear explanation of their role and the investigation result.\n\nI think it's essential to focus on the evidence presented by Player 2, rather than getting sidetracked by Player 3's conspiracy theories. Player 3's initial statement about \"my teammate\" was suspicious, and their subsequent responses have been trying to create doubt and deflect attention.\n\nI agree with Player 2 that we should trust the investigative result and lynch Player 3 today. The risk of letting a Mafia member live and potentially giving them another night-kill is too high.\n\nTo clarify, I'll reiterate my stance: I think we should vote for Player 3 based on the evidence presented by Player 2. If Player 2 is genuine, their information is invaluable, and we should act on it.\n\nLet's proceed to the final round of discussion before casting our votes.\n\n**My vote will be for Player 3 at the end of this round.**]\n[Player 4] [0]\n[Player 2] [I\u2019m sticking with the facts.\n\n1. I\u2019m the Detective and last night I received the direct message **\u201cPlayer 3 IS a Mafia member.\u201d**  \n2. Player 3\u2019s first post literally said \u201cmy teammate has already voted for Player 0.\u201d That wording only makes sense from a Mafia perspective.  \n3. Player 3 has spent every subsequent post trying to muddy the waters instead of providing any counter-evidence.\n\nAt this point the choice is simple: vote out the confirmed Mafia or hand the Mafia another free night-kill.\n\n**I vote Player 3**.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 3] Okay, I need to try to survive this vote. However, it looks like the villagers are convinced about me being the Mafia.\nI need to rally support and create a better target than me, but this seems impossible to do. Since Player 2 is very adamant, I will put my final effort to vouch Player 2 instead by using all my remaining arguments.\nI vote:\n[2]\n[Player 5] Since the game has reached the voting phase and the instructions specify that I should submit one vote in the format [X], I will now cast my vote based on the discussions.\n\nAfter reviewing the discussion, I believe that Player 3's initial statement about \"my teammate\" and Player 2's credible claim of being the Detective and investigating Player 3 provide sufficient evidence to vote for Player 3.\n\n[3]\n[Player 1] [3]\n[GAME] Player 4 attempted an invalid move.
