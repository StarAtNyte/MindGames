Knowing you're investigating Player 2 is a good starting point, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Investigations don\u2019t always paint the full picture.\"\n\n\"Player 3, I agree, the early elimination is definitely peculiar. The question is, who benefits most from it? And why?

I don't have concrete evidence yet, hence why an investigation is needed. \"\n  this vote. Let's get this right.\n\n**Round 3 Discussion:**\n\n\"Okay, we're getting somewhere.

The more information we have, the better. \"\n\n\"Player 5, still being observant is key, especially with Player 4's unfortunate departure. let's make sure we are really digging deep before the vote. let's also try to keep the tension down so everyone feels comfortable!

If that's the case, they might be trying to manipulate the discussion or create distractions.\n\nLet's keep the discussion focused and try to gather as much information as possible before we vote. Who do we think is most likely to be a threat to the Village, and who do we think is most likely to be a Villager?\n\nI'm not ready to make any accusations yet, but I do think we should consider voting for someone who has raised some suspicions or has been mentioned multiple times in the discussion.\"\n\n**Vote:**\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm going to vote for **Player 2**. My reasoning is that they've been investigated by Player 1, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they're a Mafia member, it does put them under scrutiny. Additionally, their responses have seemed a bit vague, which might indicate they're trying to hide something.\n\nPlease let me know if my vote is valid.]\n[Player 1]  Player 3 has been eliminated.\n Player 2 IS a Mafia member.\n Night phase.\n[Game] 1 of 2 Mafia members identified. 1 remains.\n[Player 0] ting point but not definitive. Player 3 has raised a valid point regarding the early elimination of Player 4; was it a genuine mistake, or something more? And I, Player 0, am keeping a watchful eye on Player 1, simply because early, decisive action can often be a tactic to mislead.\n\nI'm not ready to accuse anyone outright yet. However, I'm increasingly uneasy with Player 2. Player 5's observation of their responses, combined with being the target of the Detective's first investigation, puts them under significant pressure. Their defense, if any, will be crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, Player 1\u2019s self-proclaimed discovery isn\u2019t particularly useful. It reveals their role but doesn't give us concrete information about *who* is Mafia. It could easily be a diversion.\n\nFor this vote, I'm leaning towards **Player 2**.  Let's gauge their response. If they can provide a convincing explanation for the scrutiny, I'll re-evaluate. But for now, I think Player 2 seems most likely to harbor the most.\u201d ]\n[Player 2] [I've been watching Player 1, and their questions seem designed to gather information rather than find Mafia. That's concerning.]\n[Player 5] Okay, I understand the situation. I'm Player 5, the remaining Mafia member. Player 2 is my teammate. We know Player 1 is the Detective, and they investigated Player 2, which revealed him as a Mafia member.\n\nI need to choose a valid target for elimination. The valid targets are [0], [1], and [3]\n\nMy vote for tonight is:\n\n[Player 3] een eliminated by Player 5.\n- Player 5: Mafia member, revealed by themselves.\n\n## 3: Analyze the situation from Player 5's perspective.\nAs Player 5, the remaining Mafia member, the goal is to eliminate a Villager to keep the Mafia's numbers equal to or greater than the Villagers. The valid targets for elimination are Player 0, Player 1, and Player 3. However, since Player 3 has already been eliminated, the actual valid targets are Player 0 and Player 1.\n\n## 4: Decide on the target for elimination.\nTo keep the Mafia's chances alive, Player 5 needs to eliminate a Villager. Between Player 0 and Player 1, Player 1 is the Detective, which makes them a significant threat to the Mafia. Eliminating Player 1 would reduce the Village's ability to identify Mafia members.\n\n## 5: Make the vote.\nGiven the information and objectives, Player 5's vote for tonight should be Player 1, as eliminating the Detective would significantly hinder the Village's progress.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Player 1}$]\n[Player 1] [To begin my investigation, I will investigate **Player 2** tonight.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Player 2}}$]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
