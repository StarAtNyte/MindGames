We've barely started discussing and Player 2 hasn't really defended their actions beyond \"I'm protecting Player 1.\"\n\nPlayer 3, I appreciate you asking the tough questions. Your observation about Player 4 is also interesting \u2013 stating the obvious but trying to seem objective. Player 4, I\u2019m with Player 3 on this, your comments are very vague.

I am under suspicion, and need to defend myself.\n\nPlayer 3 asked me why I protected Player 1. The simple answer is I went with a hunch since the game just started but since I have been put under the bus, I will expand more. The reason I chose Player 1 is because I didn't see anything suspicious in their initial interactions, so I decided to play it safe. The fact that no one died last night is a good sign, meaning either the mafia missed or I did a good job.\n\nPlayer 5 wants to vote me.\nPlayer 5, I'm not sure why you're so quick to vote for me, but I am the doctor. So, I'm working for the village to protect people. You are making it hard for the village to trust anyone and play the game.

I'll wait for one more round of discussion to see people's reactions.]\n[Player 0]  should hear more from you about your suspicions. What makes you think Player 2 is mafia?

Player 0 initially was suspicious of protectors. Player 4 is being vague about Player 1. Player 1 is asking good questions.\n\nMy read right now:\n\n*   **Player 2:** Claiming Doctor very early is a bold move. Could be a valid strategy, or a bluff. I'm tentatively leaning towards them being truthful because the early claim is quite ballsy.\n*   **Player 5:** Immediately voting for Player 2 seems like a classic Mafia tactic to try and get a mislynch early. Could be a genuine read, but suspicious at this stage.\n*   **Player 0:** Suspicious of protectors. Could be playing devil's advocate to gather information?\n*   **Player 4:** Very vague and doesn't provide any actionable information. Fishy.\n*   **Player 1:** Seems to be playing the role of a concerned villager well, and the points made are reasonable.\n\nI think Player 5 is the most suspicious at this moment for immediately jumping to voting Player 2 without much reason.

No one died last night, which means either there isn't a Serial Killer, or the Doctor protected the target.

I am under suspicion, and need to defend myself.\n\nPlayer 3 asked me why I protected Player 1. The simple answer is I went with a hunch since the game just started but since I have been put under the bus, I will expand more. The reason I chose Player 1 is because I didn't see anything suspicious in their initial interactions, so I decided to play it safe.
