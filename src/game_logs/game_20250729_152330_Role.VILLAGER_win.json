It eliminates one potential threat. As for you asking about feelings before the night, I wasnt really thinking about anything in particular. It all happened so fast.\n\nMy turn: I\u2019m going to focus on Player 2 (the Doctor). They protected me last night.

We have 6 players left: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2 (me), Player 3, Player 5, and me (but I'm not a target, at least not yet).\n\nFrom the information we have, we can't pinpoint who the Mafia members are, but we can make some educated guesses.\n\nIn this discussion phase, I'd like to ask: What do we know about the players who were not targeted last night? Was it just random, or is there something we can infer?\n\nLet's discuss... \n\nMy turn: I'll start by saying that I think we should focus on finding out who might be a Mafia member.

      "Turn 5: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 3.\nYour role: Villager\nDescription: A regular villager. Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 4 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Let's think this through. \n\nSo, Player 4 was killed during the night. That means the Mafia is still among us. As the Doctor, my goal is to protect one player each night, and last night I protected Player 0.\n\nNow that the day has broken, let's discuss. We have 6 players left: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2 (me), Player 3, Player 5, and me (but I'm not a target, at least not yet).\n\nFrom the information we have, we can't pinpoint who the Mafia members are, but we can make some educated guesses.\n\nIn this discussion phase, I'd like to ask: What do we know about the players who were not targeted last night? Was it just random, or is there something we can infer?\n\n\nMy turn: I'll start by saying that I think we should focus on finding out who might be a Mafia member. We should share any information or suspicions we have.\n\nYour turns!]\n[Player 5] Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I'm the **Detective** from the Village team, so my job is to investigate and identify Mafia members. Since it's already daytime, and we just lost Player 4 last night, our top priority should be figuring out who the Mafia is before they take out another one of us.\n\nNow, Player 2 claims to be the **Doctor**, and they said they protected Player 0 last night. That might explain why Player 0 wasn't killed \u2014 unless they\u2019re lying, which could also be a possibility.\n\nPlayer 4 was killed, and that tells us the Mafia made a move. But now we have to think \u2014 who had the opportunity? And who might be hiding something?\n\nSince I\u2019m the Detective, I\u2019ll start with my first move:\n\n****\n\nLet\u2019s find out \u2014 is Player 3 part of the Mafia?\n\n\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f *Night Phase - Investigation Result: Player 3 is NOT a Mafia member.*\n[Player 1] [Okay, that's valuable information! We know Player 3 is not Mafia.\n\nPlayer 2, as the Doctor, protected Player 0. This could be true, and it could also be a lie (though a doctor claiming to protect someone is a classic Village play). However, we can't be certain.\n\nThe Detective, Player 5, investigated Player 3 and cleared them.\n\n\n*   Player 3: Village\n*   Player 0: Potentially protected by the Doctor (Player 2).\n\n\nMy current assessment is that Player 3 is cleared, and we know Player 5 is the Detective. Knowing the roles is useful to assess the other players.\n\n**My turn:**\n\nI'd like to know from Player 0 and Player 3: Did you have any strong feelings about who might be Mafia before the night phase? Did you suspect anyone in particular? I am asking both of you because I am suspecting that there might be players that are trying to lie to us.]\n[Player 0]  Day breaks.
