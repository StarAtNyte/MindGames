As the Detective, my goal is to investigate players to find Mafia members and help the Village win. Last night, I investigated Player 0 and found out that they are indeed a Mafia member. Unfortunately, Player 2 was killed during the night.\n\nFrom the information I have, I know Player 0 is a Mafia member. Now, let's discuss and gather more information. I will start by asking questions.\n\nPlayer 1, can you tell me a bit about yourself? Do you have any information about the Mafia?\n\nAlso, I think it's essential to discuss the possibilities of who could be the Mafia and who might be an innocent villager.\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n* Mafia members: Player 0 (confirmed)\n* Killed during the night: Player 2\n\nPlease respond, and let's discuss!]\n[Player 5] er 3 is the Detective and has identified Player 0 as Mafia - that\u2019s huge! My priority is to solidify this information and help the Village.\n\n [**Day Phase - Round 1**\n\nThanks for the update, Player 3! This is extremely valuable information. Knowing Player 0 is Mafia significantly changes the landscape.\n\nPlayer 1, I understand Player 3 asked for your input, and you're right to suggest we consider possibilities. Let\u2019s focus on Player 0 for now. Player 0, you\u2019ve been awfully quiet so far. Any comments on Player 3's accusation? Do you want to explain yourself? Just silence from you will look quite suspicious.\n\nWe need to make sure Player 3's information is solid. Does anyone else have any observations about Player 0\u2019s behaviour or anything else they\u2019ve said? Let's keep a close eye on everyone, especially those who seem to be defending Player 0 without much evidence. We need to be methodical and avoid mistakenly targeting innocent players. Let's work together to expose the Mafia!]\n[Player 4] [**Day Phase - Round 1**\n\nGood morning. I\u2019m Player 4, the Doctor, and my role is to protect players at night from Mafia elimination. Unfortunately, Player 2 was killed last night, and we now know Player 0 is confirmed Mafia thanks to Player 3\u2019s investigation. That\u2019s huge progress, and I appreciate Player 3 sharing that early.\n\nSince I can only protect one player per night, I need to make informed decisions based on our discussions and behavior during the day. I vote we focus heavily on eliminating Player 0 in today\u2019s vote. There's no reason to keep a confirmed Mafia member alive \u2014 it only gives them more opportunities to mislead and kill others.\n\nPlayer 0, you haven\u2019t spoken yet. As the group mentioned, your silence is suspicious. And to the rest of you: let\u2019s not overcomplicate this. If we eliminate Player 0 now, we reduce the Mafia\u2019s numbers and improve our chances of protecting someone else tonight.\n\nLet\u2019s stay focused. Does anyone disagree with the plan to vote out Player 0 today?]\n[Player 0] gger scenario. We should analyze the behavior and statements made so far. For example, Player 3 immediately revealed that they investigated me and shared the result. It's a bold strategy, and it could be genuine or a tactic to distract.\n\nLet's not just target me without thinking about the potential outcomes. Eliminating me will indeed reduce the Mafia's count by 1. However, we need to consider who will be the Mafia's target tonight. Perhaps we should identify potential threats to our team and analyze their actions.\n\nI think Player 4, as the Doctor, has a significant role. They can save one person each night. It would be strategic for them to reveal more about their role or their thought process. Player 4, can you share your strategy for tonight's save? Who do you plan to save, and what makes you think that person is in danger? \n\nThis discussion is not about defending or attacking anyone but about making the most informed choices. Let's be cautious and gather as much insight as we can.]",

Perhaps we should identify potential threats to our team and analyze their actions.\n\nI think Player 4, as the Doctor, has a significant role. They can save one person each night. It would be strategic for them to reveal more about their role or their thought process. Player 4, can you share your strategy for tonight's save?
