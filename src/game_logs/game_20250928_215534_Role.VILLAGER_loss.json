      "Turn 2: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 3.\nYour role: Villager\nDescription: A regular villager. Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 1 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks.

My gut says we should keep an eye on Player\u202f4; they\u2019ve been unusually quiet and seemed nervous during the night. Let\u2019s discuss what everyone saw and decide if we should put them on the ballot.]\n[Player 5] [Okay, I understand. I am the Detective (Player 5) and my goal is to find the Mafia.\n\nI will investigate Player 4.]\n[Player 4]  [Hold on, let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. I\u2019m a regular Villager, and I was asleep during the night\u2014like everyone else except the Mafia. Being quiet doesn\u2019t make me scum; I just didn\u2019t have anything to add while the game was still at night. If Player 5 really is the Detective, then sure\u2014check me tonight. But if I\u2019m cleared, we\u2019ll have wasted a day vote and given the Mafia another free night. Instead, let\u2019s look at who\u2019s pushing hardest right now.

Their immediate accusation against Player 4 without concrete evidence raises red flags. Additionally, Player 5\u2019s quick support might indicate they\u2019re aligning with someone they believe to be trustworthy, which could be a tactic to mislead us.]\n[Player 0]  [I'm not sure who to trust right now.

If the Detective actually is a real role, they\u2019ll be a big threat to us soon, so the Mafia would want to neutralize them before they can expose us.\n\nThat means the real danger right now is the player claiming to be the Detective\u2014Player\u202f5. If they truly have investigative power, they\u2019ll soon uncover one of us, and the rest of the village will be on high alert. On the other hand, Player\u202f4\u2019s silence could just be a tactic to avoid drawing attention.\n\nSo my suggestion: let\u2019s keep the discussion open and focus on what the Detective is doing. If Player\u202f5 truly is the Detective, they\u2019ll produce concrete evidence soon. Until then, we should be wary of any claims that try to shift blame without proof\u2014like the quick accusation against Player\u202f4. Let\u2019s hear more from Players\u202f0 and\u202f3, and see if anyone can point to inconsistencies in Player\u202f5\u2019s investigation. The more we stall, the better for us.]\n[Player 5] [Okay, I understand. As the Detective (Player 5), I need to find the Mafia.\n\nGiven the discussion, Player 0 and Player 3 haven't been very forthcoming. I will stick to my plan and continue to investigate.\n\nDuring the night phase, I will investigate Player 4.]\n[Player 4] \u2019re implying you have an unlimited set of checks, which breaks the standard rules. That sounds much more like a Mafia member trying to look busy while buying time than like a genuine power role.\n\nContrast that with Player 2, who just flipped their own script. A moment ago they pushed for me based on \u201cgut,\u201d then almost immediately pivoted to telling us to be suspicious of the \u201cDetective,\u201d spreading fear that a Detective reveal would paint a target on their back. On Day 1 we have zero confirmed info on anyone except that Player 1 is dead, so that \u201cfear\u201d is premature theatrics. The scum side\u2019s classic Day-1 play is to manufacture confusion to keep good wagons from forming.\n\nIf we\u2019re left with no trustworthy cop claim, the only coherent move is to sort the loud voices that keep waffling and contradicting themselves: Players 2 and 5. Between them, Player 5\u2019s claim is mechanically impossible; that\u2019s an outright, rules-level deception. I\u2019m willing to go to the block over this: Vote Player 5.]",
