Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 3 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] [I'm glad to be alive and playing. Okay, let's get down to business. We just lost Player3 during the night, and now it's our chance to discuss and vote out a player we suspect might be a Mafia member.\n\n**Round 1 of Discussion:**\nFrom what I know, we have no information about Player3's role, but their sudden death suggests they might have been a threat to the Mafia. I'm going to start by asking: what do we know about the remaining players? Are there any suspicious behaviors or actions that have been noticed so far?\n\n(I'll wait for responses before continuing to the next round)]",
