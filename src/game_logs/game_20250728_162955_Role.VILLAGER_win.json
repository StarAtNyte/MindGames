Protecting Player 3 allowed me to gather more information without immediately putting focus on them. Now that Player 5 is confirmed as Mafia, it\u2019s clear that my assessment was off. I apologize for any confusion this caused. I agree we need to examine both Player 3 and Player 0 closely moving forward to ensure we eliminate the remaining Mafia threat. Who do you suggest we put up for investigation next?\"\n[Player 0] ut appearing to manipulate. \n\nNight: Investigate Player 3.\n\n\n\n\n\"Player 3's evasiveness and reluctance to fully engage in the discussion are certainly concerning, especially given the current context. I am completely aligned with Player 2's approach \u2013 allowing them to conduct their investigation without undue pressure. My previous judgement was flawed, resulting in a misguided protection of Player 3 as an attempt to gather more information \u2013 a mistake I acknowledge and regret. It is clear now this strategy was not as insightful as I had hoped. I am confident that Player 2's current investigation will shed further light on Player 3's role. Let's give them space to conclude their findings. Once Player 2 has finished, I would like to hear their reasoning and any evidence they uncovered. For now, I will set aside my own investigative approaches. Who do you think we should try to investigate next?\"\n\n\n\nNight phase - choose one player to investigate: [0], [2], [3], [4]\n\n[Player 2] [3]\n[Player 3] \"Based on the current game dynamic and the suspicions surrounding Player 3, I think the best course of action is to continue to observe Player 3. It would be best for one of us to investigate them to continue their work from what we have discovered today by listening to their strategy. I choose Player 3. I will investigate [3].\"\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 3] I need to vote now based on information available. Player 3 is the remaining mafia member. I will vote to eliminate Player 3.\n\n[3]\n[Player 0] t\u2019s see what we can uncover.\"\n\n**Night Phase - Choose one player to investigate: [3]**\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of My Actions & Reasoning (Behind the Detective Mask):**\n\n*   **Acknowledging Mistakes:** Admitting my earlier decision was a misjudgment is crucial. It shows I'm willing to learn and adapt, which protects me from being immediately suspected of being the Mafia.\n*   **Reinforcing Suspicion of Both:** Validating Player 4\u2019s points about Player 3 and Player 5 reinforces the overall narrative of suspicion without excessively targeting anyone.\n*   **Strategic Investigation:** Knowing Player 5 as Mafia, it makes sense to turn focus on Player 3. This adds to the complexity for the Mafia and provides crucial information.\n*   **Maintaining Cover:** As a detective, I should seem cautious and thoughtful. By stating my reasoning calmly and objectively, I avoid drawing unwanted attention to myself.\n\nI'm excited to see what happens after my investigation of Player 3! Let me know what's revealed.\n[Player 4] Okay, I understand the instructions. Here's my move, focusing on securing the Village win:\n\n```\n[3]\n```\n[GAME] Player 5 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties."
