Their quickness to suspect Player 3 and their own aggressive defense during the voting seem strategically aimed at redirecting suspicion. We need to be cautious but also ensure we don't lynch the wrong person. I propose we keep an eye on Player 5 and continue gathering observations in this discussion.\n[Player 0] [**Vote: Player 5**  \n**Action: Continue monitoring Player 5 closely and remain vigilant.**  \n\nI will use the day discussion to reinforce the idea that Player 5 is the Mafia member. I\u2019ll focus on pointing out their aggressive behavior and quick suspicions during the previous vote, as well as their coordination with Player 0.

If the mod allows a new choice, I\u2019m still sticking with  as the mathematically safest protect for the same reasons\u2014only one of {0,5} can be scum, leaving 1 with the highest targeted-probability.\n\nToday we hit LyLo, so every word counts. I\u2019ll open with the mechanical lock we have:\n\n- If I\u2019m alive tomorrow, my continued doc-target (tonight again ) is a free cleared; any kill that doesn\u2019t come through me confirms the person not-shielded.  \n- Conversely, if we lynch incorrectly today, scum can only shoot the unprotected slot (0 or me), leading to a 2-person final day.\n\nPut together, the optimal village strategy is straightforward: pick the more wolfy of {0,5} and end it now.\n\nScum already know the exact POE today, so any attempt to re-open that or \u201cboth are suspish, need more thoughts\u201d is just burn-clock.\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
