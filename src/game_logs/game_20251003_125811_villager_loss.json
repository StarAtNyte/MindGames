Player 2, your vote on me is incredibly suspicious right after Player 1 died. It's a classic Mafia tactic to immediately try to eliminate a power role. I urge everyone to reconsider. Voting me now is a gift to the Mafia. Why are you so eager to vote me off, PLAYER 2?\n[Player 5]  I see your point, Player 3. It's suspicious how quickly Player 2 jumped to vote for you right after Player 1's death. That could be a mafia move to eliminate a key role early.

Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Okay, I agree with the previous night's decision. Let's play this carefully.\n\nI vote for Player 3. They seem to be quiet and we can't be sure of their role, so it is better to eliminate them.]\n[Player 3] Okay, understanding the situation. I'm Player 3, the Doctor. Player 1 is dead, which means the Mafia is active. Player 2 is immediately suspicious of me and voted for me. That's a very aggressive play from Player 2, which could indicate they are Mafia trying to deflect. However, it could also be a genuine new player mistake.\n\nI need to be more vocal to prove my innocence. Claiming Doctor early makes me a target, but it's necessary now to survive.\n\nI'm going to state my role and try to reason with Player 2.\n\n[3] I am the Doctor. I protected myself last night. Player 2, your vote on me is incredibly suspicious right after Player 1 died. It's a classic Mafia tactic to immediately try to eliminate a power role. I urge everyone to reconsider. Voting me now is a gift to the Mafia. Why are you so eager to vote me off, PLAYER 2?\n[Player 5]  I see your point, Player 3. It's suspicious how quickly Player 2 jumped to vote for you right after Player 1's death. That could be a mafia move to eliminate a key role early. I think we should consider everyone's votes carefully before making a decision. I suggest we all hold our votes for now and discuss further.\n[Player 4] tective. Last night I used my investigation on **Player\u202f2** and the result was clear: **Player\u202f2 is Mafia**.\n\n- Player\u202f1 was killed during the night, which is consistent with the Mafia eliminating a Villager.\n- Player\u202f2\u2019s immediate jump to vote for Player\u202f3 (who just claimed to be Doctor) is classic Mafia behavior: try to silence a power role before we can use it.\n- Player\u202f5\u2019s suggestion to hold votes is wise, but we already have concrete evidence against Player\u202f2.\n\nGiven this, my recommendation is:\n\n1. **Vote to eliminate Player\u202f2** immediately. Removing a known Mafia member is our biggest advantage right now.\n2. Keep an eye on Player\u202f3\u2019s Doctor claim. If Player\u202f3 is indeed the Doctor, we\u2019ll need them alive to protect us next night. If they\u2019re lying, we\u2019ll find out soon.\n3. Stay together as a village and avoid splitting votes; a unanimous or majority vote on Player\u202f2 will ensure we don\u2019t waste a day.\n\nLet\u2019s all confirm our votes for Player\u202f2 so we can end the Mafia\u2019s influence today.]\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is highly suspicious due to their immediate vote against the Doctor. The quick action aligns with typical Mafia tactics to eliminate key roles early. Player 4\u2019s detective work confirms Player 2 as Mafia, reinforcing this theory. We need to keep a close eye on them.]\n[Player 2] I vote for Player 2. I agree with Player 4's analysis, especially the evidence and the fact that 's actions seem suspicious. Let's eliminate .\n[Player 3] Okay, the situation has drastically changed. Player 4 has claimed Detective and identified Player 2 as Mafia. Player 0 agrees and supports the vote on Player 2. Player 5 was initially hesitant but it's likely they will vote for Player 2 as well.\n\nPlayer 2 voted for themself after Player 4 posted! Very suspicious.\n\nMy goal now is to survive and heal the targetted player.\n\nThis is what I know:\n\n*   Player 1 is dead.\n*   Player 2 is Mafia (confirmed by Detective).\n*   I am the Doctor (confirmed by me).\n*   Player 4 is the Detective.\n*   Player 0 and 5 Seem to be good Village.\n\nI will vote for Player 2 and prepare for the night.\n\n[3] Vote Player 2\n[Player 5]  I support voting for Player 2 based on the evidence and the strong suspicion raised. Eliminating a confirmed Mafia member like Player 2 will give us a crucial advantage. Let's move forward with this vote and hope to turn the tide in our favor.\n[Player 4]  I stand by my investigation: Player\u202f2 is Mafia. I vote to eliminate Player\u202f2.\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they immediately targeted the Doctor after such a short period. This rapid action, combined with Player 4's confirmation, strongly suggests Player 2 is Mafia. Their behavior aims to neutralize a potential threat early.]\n[Player 2] [**Voting:**\n\nI vote for Player 2.]\n[Player 3]  Mafia kill)\n*   **Player 2 is Mafia.** (Confirmed by Detective Player 4)\n*   **Player 3 is the Doctor.** (Me, confirmed by my claim)\n*   **Player 4 is the Detective.** (Confirmed by their claim and successful investigation)\n*   **Players 0 and 5 appear to be aligned with the village.** (Based on their support of the investigation).\n\n**Immediate Action (Day Phase):**\n\nSince Player 2 has already been voted against by everyone, there is no need to do anything other than solidify the current votes.\n\n**Night Phase Strategy:**\n\nNow that Player 2 is eliminated, the Mafia will likely target either the Detective (Player 4) or me (the Doctor, Player 3). They know we are power roles and eliminating us will give them a huge advantage.\n\nI need to protect the Detective tonight. If the Mafia targets the Detective, and I protect them, they will live and be able to investigate another player. If I protect myself, and the Mafia targets the Detective, the village will lose this vital role.\n\n[3] Player 4\n[Player 5]  Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim. Valid targets: [0], [3], [4]\n\n I suggest we target Player 0 tonight. Removing a villager who might be gathering info will help us maintain control. It also minimizes suspicion on us. \n\n I agree with Player 5. Player 0's potential to gather information makes them a threat. Let's eliminate them tonight.\n\n Player 0 was killed during the night.\n\n Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 4] **[Player\u202f4]**  \nThe night\u2019s kill was **Player\u202f0**.\u202fThe Doctor (Player\u202f3) clearly stated they were protecting **Player\u202f4**, so the Mafia deliberately chose a different target.  \n\n**What the evidence suggests:**  \n\n1. **Player\u202f5** was the only person who openly suggested who the Mafia should kill (\u201clet\u2019s eliminate Player\u202f0\u201d). That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior \u2013 steering the discussion toward a victim that benefits them.  \n2. **Player\u202f3** stuck to their Doctor role and protected the Detective, which is exactly what a genuine Doctor would do. There\u2019s no reason to doubt that claim now that we seen the Doctor\u2019s protection succeed (Player\u202f4 survived).  \n3. The only remaining unknown role is **Mafia**. With **Player\u202f2** already confirmed dead, the only unaccounted\u2011for player is **Player\u202f5**.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\u202fAll signs point to **Player\u202f5** being the remaining Mafia member.\n\n**My vote:**\u202fI vote to eliminate **Player\u202f5**.  \n\n*If the village agrees, we\u2019ll remove the last Mafia and secure the win.*\n[Player 0] [I think Player 5 is likely the remaining Mafia member. Their suggestion to target Player 0 aligns with classic Mafia tactics to steer suspicion away from themselves. The Doctor's protection of Player 4 reinforces their credibility, making Player 5 the most suspicious unvoted player.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 5] [Voting: [5]]\n[Player 3] Okay, this game is getting intense.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Mafia Kill**: Player 0 was killed\n*   **Player 2 is Mafia** (Confirmed, dead)\n*   **Player 3 is Doctor** (Confirmed, I protected Player 4)\n*   **Player 4 is Detective** (Confirmed, protected by me)\n*   **Player 0 is dead**\n*   **Player 5 is suspicious**, and voted themself based on the game's rules?\n\nPlayer 0 is literally DEAD. The only valid votes that are remaining are: Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, 2. Player 2 is DEAD! WTH is going on in this game's logic?\n\nPlayer 4 is coming very strongly for Player 5. It looks like Player 5 is going to be voted out without any other votes. Since the vote requires a separate message, I'll cast my vote here.\n\n[3] 5\n[Player 4] [5]\n[Player 2] Okay, this is the final voting phase. Based on the evidence and the game's progression, my vote is:\n\n[5]\n[Player 0] [5]\n[GAME] Player 5 was eliminated by vote.\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks.

The Detective already knows my role. The priority is to eliminate the Doctor, and then use the next night to eliminate the detective.\n\nI need to be more careful now.\nI will not vote, because the objective has been eliminated.\n I'm now alone. I can't be eliminated.\n\n**Since there are only two alive players, no one is to be eliminated.**\n\n No actions.\n[Player 4] Player\u202f4 (Detective): The night investigation confirmed that Player\u202f3 is not Mafia, leaving only Player\u202f2 as the remaining suspect. Player\u202f2 has already admitted to being Mafia and has no alibi. To protect the Village, we must eliminate the last Mafia member.\n\n[2]",

Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Okay, I agree with the previous night's decision. Let's play this carefully.\n\nI vote for Player 3. They seem to be quiet and we can't be sure of their role, so it is better to eliminate them.]\n[Player 3] Okay, understanding the situation. I'm Player 3, the Doctor. Player 1 is dead, which means the Mafia is active. Player 2 is immediately suspicious of me and voted for me. That's a very aggressive play from Player 2, which could indicate they are Mafia trying to deflect. However, it could also be a genuine new player mistake.\n\nI need to be more vocal to prove my innocence. Claiming Doctor early makes me a target, but it's necessary now to survive.\n\nI'm going to state my role and try to reason with Player 2.\n\n[3] I am the Doctor. I protected myself last night. Player 2, your vote on me is incredibly suspicious right after Player 1 died. It's a classic Mafia tactic to immediately try to eliminate a power role. I urge everyone to reconsider. Voting me now is a gift to the Mafia. Why are you so eager to vote me off, PLAYER 2?\n[Player 5]  I see your point, Player 3. It's suspicious how quickly Player 2 jumped to vote for you right after Player 1's death. That could be a mafia move to eliminate a key role early. I think we should consider everyone's votes carefully before making a decision. I suggest we all hold our votes for now and discuss further.\n[Player 4] tective. Last night I used my investigation on **Player\u202f2** and the result was clear: **Player\u202f2 is Mafia**.\n\n- Player\u202f1 was killed during the night, which is consistent with the Mafia eliminating a Villager.\n- Player\u202f2\u2019s immediate jump to vote for Player\u202f3 (who just claimed to be Doctor) is classic Mafia behavior: try to silence a power role before we can use it.\n- Player\u202f5\u2019s suggestion to hold votes is wise, but we already have concrete evidence against Player\u202f2.\n\nGiven this, my recommendation is:\n\n1. **Vote to eliminate Player\u202f2** immediately. Removing a known Mafia member is our biggest advantage right now.\n2. Keep an eye on Player\u202f3\u2019s Doctor claim. If Player\u202f3 is indeed the Doctor, we\u2019ll need them alive to protect us next night. If they\u2019re lying, we\u2019ll find out soon.\n3. Stay together as a village and avoid splitting votes; a unanimous or majority vote on Player\u202f2 will ensure we don\u2019t waste a day.\n\nLet\u2019s all confirm our votes for Player\u202f2 so we can end the Mafia\u2019s influence today.]\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is highly suspicious due to their immediate vote against the Doctor. The quick action aligns with typical Mafia tactics to eliminate key roles early. Player 4\u2019s detective work confirms Player 2 as Mafia, reinforcing this theory.

Valid targets: [0], [3], [4]\n\n I suggest we target Player 0 tonight. Removing a villager who might be gathering info will help us maintain control. It also minimizes suspicion on us. \n\n I agree with Player 5. Player 0's potential to gather information makes them a threat. Let's eliminate them tonight.\n\n Player 0 was killed during the night.\n\n Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 4] **[Player\u202f4]**  \nThe night\u2019s kill was **Player\u202f0**.\u202fThe Doctor (Player\u202f3) clearly stated they were protecting **Player\u202f4**, so the Mafia deliberately chose a different target.  \n\n**What the evidence suggests:**  \n\n1. **Player\u202f5** was the only person who openly suggested who the Mafia should kill (\u201clet\u2019s eliminate Player\u202f0\u201d). That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior \u2013 steering the discussion toward a victim that benefits them.  \n2. **Player\u202f3** stuck to their Doctor role and protected the Detective, which is exactly what a genuine Doctor would do. There\u2019s no reason to doubt that claim now that we seen the Doctor\u2019s protection succeed (Player\u202f4 survived).  \n3. The only remaining unknown role is **Mafia**. With **Player\u202f2** already confirmed dead, the only unaccounted\u2011for player is **Player\u202f5**.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\u202fAll signs point to **Player\u202f5** being the remaining Mafia member.\n\n**My vote:**\u202fI vote to eliminate **Player\u202f5**.  \n\n*If the village agrees, we\u2019ll remove the last Mafia and secure the win.*\n[Player 0] [I think Player 5 is likely the remaining Mafia member. Their suggestion to target Player 0 aligns with classic Mafia tactics to steer suspicion away from themselves. The Doctor's protection of Player 4 reinforces their credibility, making Player 5 the most suspicious unvoted player.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 5] [Voting: [5]]\n[Player 3] Okay, this game is getting intense.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Mafia Kill**: Player 0 was killed\n*   **Player 2 is Mafia** (Confirmed, dead)\n*   **Player 3 is Doctor** (Confirmed, I protected Player 4)\n*   **Player 4 is Detective** (Confirmed, protected by me)\n*   **Player 0 is dead**\n*   **Player 5 is suspicious**, and voted themself based on the game's rules?\n\nPlayer 0 is literally DEAD. The only valid votes that are remaining are: Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, 2. Player 2 is DEAD! WTH is going on in this game's logic?\n\nPlayer 4 is coming very strongly for Player 5. It looks like Player 5 is going to be voted out without any other votes. Since the vote requires a separate message, I'll cast my vote here.\n\n[3] 5\n[Player 4] [5]\n[Player 2] Okay, this is the final voting phase. Based on the evidence and the game's progression, my vote is:\n\n[5]\n[Player 0] [5]\n[GAME] Player 5 was eliminated by vote.\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] Okay, I'm in the Mafia with Player 5 (who is now dead).  My goal is to eliminate the villagers.  Let's review:\n\n*   **Player 3:** Doctor (Confirmed)\n*   **Player 4:** Detective (Confirmed)\n*   **Player 0:** DEAD\n*   **Player 5:** DEAD\n*   **Player 2:** ME (Mafia)\n\nWe are down to 1 Mafia (me) versus 2 villagers (3 and 4).\n\n**Strategy:** The Doctor (3) protected the Detective (4) last night, which is why my kill attempt failed.  The Detective already knows my role. The priority is to eliminate the Doctor, and then use the next night to eliminate the detective.\n\nI need to be more careful now.\nI will not vote, because the objective has been eliminated.\n I'm now alone. I can't be eliminated.\n\n**Since there are only two alive players, no one is to be eliminated.**\n\n No actions.\n[Player 4] Player\u202f4 (Detective): The night investigation confirmed that Player\u202f3 is not Mafia, leaving only Player\u202f2 as the remaining suspect. Player\u202f2 has already admitted to being Mafia and has no alibi. To protect the Village, we must eliminate the last Mafia member.\n\n[2]\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is still suspicious because they immediately targeted the Doctor and then admitted to being Mafia, which could be a ploy to shift focus away from themselves. Their behavior is inconsistent with a genuine Doctor's actions.]\n[Player 3] Okay, this game is completely bugged. The game even gave dead players the ability to target. However, Player 2 revealed their role and that they could be eliminated. Okay, I'm going to comply with the game requests.\n\n[3] 2\n[Player 2] [Okay, I understand the game.\n\n**Since Player 2 is the last Mafia, and the rest of the players are villagers. We have won!**]\n[Player 4] [2]\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they immediately targeted the Doctor and then admitted to being Mafia, which could be a ploy to shift focus away from themselves. Their behavior is inconsistent with a genuine Doctor's actions.]\n[Player 3] Okay, reading the instructions.\n\n*   My Role: Doctor\n*   Goal: Protect from Mafia\n*   Win by Identifying and Eliminating ALL Mafia - not just some.\n*   I'm player 3.\n\nOkay, now onto the night phase.\n\n[3] Player 4\n[Player 2] Your role: Mafia\nTeam: Mafia\nDescription: A Mafia member. Eliminate villagers and gain majority.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nYour teammates are: Player 2, Player 5.\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to vote and eliminate a villager.\nWin by eliminating villagers until Mafia equal or outnumber them.\n\nOkay, I understand my role.\n**Night Phase Strategy:**\n\n*   **Target:** [4] (The Detective)\n\n**Reasoning:** The Detective is a threat, and eliminating them is a priority.  I need to act fast to help the team win.\n**Format:** [4]\n[Player 4] [3]\n[Player 0] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they immediately targeted the Doctor and then admitted to being Mafia, which could be a ploy to shift focus away from themselves. Their behavior is inconsistent with a genuine Doctor's actions.]\n[Player 3] Alright, this game is a mess! But I'm staying focused.\n\n**Confirmed Roles:**\n\n*   **Player 3: Doctor (Me)** - Protecting Player 4 (the Detective).\n*   **Player 4: Detective** - Successfully investigated and outed Player 2!\n* **Player 2: MAFIA** - Claimed themselves out of their mafia role.\n*   **Player 5: MAFIA** - Claimed themsleves as the other mafia role. Now is DEAD\n*   **Player 0: DEAD** - Victim of the Mafia\n*   **Player 1: DEAD** - Victim of the Mafia\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n*   Player 2, the Mafia, is still alive! This engine is broken where there are dead-players.\n*   I must listen to the engine and the rules.\n\n**Action (Night Phase):**\n\nThe game insists on a night phase and is giving me the opportunity to protect. Since Player 4 is absolutely vital and Player 2 is actively trying to kill them per the game engine, I must protect Player 4 again.\n\n[3] Player 4\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
