While it's true I've been asking questions, I think it's because I'm trying to understand the dynamics of the game and gather more information. I'm not sure it's fair to say that I'm not providing analysis, as I'm trying to contribute to the discussion.\n\nLet's keep the discussion going and see if we can uncover more about the other players.

You said \"evidence is strongest,\" but then you pivoted to the \"asking questions\" Mafia tell and pointed it at Player 0. That feels a bit... convenient, almost like you're trying to jump on Player 4's bandwagon.

Based on the discussion, I will vote according to the other Mafia member, Player 2. However, I don't know their vote. I'll have to analyze the conversation to make an educated guess.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's vote, I'll look at the conversation to determine the most likely target. It seems like Player 4 is the most likely to be voted out due to their accusation against me. To align with Player 2, if they voted for someone other than me (since we are on the same team and both voted for Player 5 during the night), I'll vote for a player who isn't me.\n\nLet's vote.\n\nVote: Player 4.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Based on the discussion, I will vote according to the other Mafia member, Player 2. However, I don't know their vote. I'll have to analyze the conversation to make an educated guess.\n\nSince I don't know Player 2's vote, I'll look at the conversation to determine the most likely target. It seems like Player 4 is the most likely to be voted out due to their accusation against me. To align with Player 2, if they voted for someone other than me (since we are on the same team and both voted for Player 5 during the night), I'll vote for a player who isn't me.\n\nLet's vote.\n\nVote: Player 4.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
