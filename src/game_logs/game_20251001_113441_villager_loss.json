Their behavior before death might hold clues. Player 2, did you notice anything unusual about how Player 5 interacted during the last night phase?]\n[Player 4] [I protected Player 1 last night because they seemed cautious and might be a target. What do you all think about Player 5's elimination\u2014did anyone notice anything unusual about them before they died?]\n[Player 1] which is unusual. Maybe they were protecting another player. Player 0, what do you think about Player 5\u2019s behavior and its implications?\n\n**Day Phase: Vote**\n\n Considering Player 5\u2019s strategic behavior and the unusual silence from Player 2, I vote for Player 2 as the victim. They could be the one hiding something.\n\n I agree with Player 1. Player 2\u2019s quiet demeanor and Player 5\u2019s elimination both point to Player 2 potentially being involved in something we might miss during the night.\n\n I vote for Player 2 as well. Their cautious and quiet behavior aligns with the idea of hiding something, especially considering the strategic nature of Player 5\u2019s elimination.\n\n I will also vote for Player 2. Their behavior and the elimination of Player 5 both hint at possible deception. We should not assume that Player 2 is safe just because they haven\u2019t said much.\n\nThe votes are in. Player 2 will be next. We will continue our investigation during the night phase.\n[Player 3] [2]\n[Player 2]  All votes are cast. Player 2 has been eliminated.\n\nIt\u2019s now night. Roles and alignments are hidden, and players prepare for the next day of discussion.",
