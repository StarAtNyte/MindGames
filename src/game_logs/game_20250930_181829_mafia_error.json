Eliminate villagers and gain majority.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nYour teammates are: Player 1, Player 3.\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to vote and eliminate a villager.\nWin by eliminating villagers until Mafia equal or outnumber them.\n\n[GAME] Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim.\nValid targets: [0], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 1] Received \u2013 Mafia chat: deciding whom to eliminate.\n\nMy analysis:\n- Player 4 resisted voting for Player 2 at the end of Day 1. This makes them look town-aligned.\n- Player 5 pushed a mis-lynch onto Player 2 with very little resistance and didn\u2019t try to protect anyone, which reads neutral-scummish.\n- Player 0 has been the quietest overall and never drew any heat\u2014classic low-threat villager profile.\n- Player 2 is our partner and already flipped.\n\nConclusion: Player 4 is the cleanest town read remaining and the biggest long-term threat to us. Remove them now and it keeps suspicion on others tomorrow.\n\nVote: [4]",
