Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 4 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] [Player 1: I think eliminating Player 0 was a good move. It’ll help us thin out the villagers. Let’s see how they react today.]\n[Player 3] [Player 1 is trying to throw suspicion off the Mafia by pretending to act in the village's interest. However, their comment about \"thinning out the villagers\" is suspicious and could be a sign they are part of the Mafia. Since I am a villager, my goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia members. I need to be careful and observe who is acting strangely or making inconsistent statements. I will listen to the other players' comments and try to figure out who might be the Mafia. I will also try to build trust with other villagers to work together in the vote. Let's see what others have to say.]\n[Player 0]  I protected Player 3 last night, which means they must be a villager—mafia wouldn't target their own. Seeing Player 4 die instead suggests the Mafia guessed wrong or intentionally hit an ally for cover. Both of you have good points: Player 1's phrasing (\"thin out the villagers\") does sound like it came from a Mafia perspective, not a villager's. Player 3, thanks for stepping up with analysis.\n\nLet's keep our logic crisp:\n- Player 3 stayed alive because I shielded them ⇒ likely village.\n- Player 1's early-game distancing language is suspicious; typical mafia deflection.\n- Player 2 and Player 5 haven't spoken yet—their silence or first statements will be telling.\n\nFor now, I'm leaning toward Player 1 as our first target, but we should hear from Player 2 and Player 5 next round before locking in votes.\n[Player 2] Okay, I understand. I am the Detective and I know that Player 1 is Mafia. Player 0 and Player 3 have already done a great job analyzing the situation. I will vote for Player 1.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n*   **Mafia:** Player 1 (Confirmed)\n*   **Innocent:** Player 0, Player 3\n*   **Dead:** Player 4\n*   **Unspoken:** Player 2, Player 5\n\nI will vote for Player 1.\n\n**My Vote:** I vote for \\.",
