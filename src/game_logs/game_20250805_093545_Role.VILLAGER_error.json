Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 0 has been eliminated by making an invalid move..\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 2] [Since I'm the remaining Mafia and my vote didn't result in eliminating anyone last night (likely due to Player 0's invalid move causing a conflict), I'll use the day phase to analyze and manipulate the situation.\n\nLet's start by discussing. It seems Player 0 made an invalid move, which is quite suspicious. I think we should investigate more into this. Player 0's action might not have been a genuine mistake; it could be a strategy or an attempt to confuse us.\n\nTo the group, my question is: What do you think happened with Player 0's move last night? Was it a genuine error or something else? \n\nLet's discuss and figure out the best course of action.]",

This is a common tactic used by the Mafia to confuse and manipulate the villagers. Given the recent invalid move and the resulting chaos, it's highly likely that Player 0 is either a member of the Mafia or at least acting suspiciously. We need to keep an eye on them closely as they may be trying to cover their tracks.",
