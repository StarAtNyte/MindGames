If Player 2 is a villager, their quick earlier response indicates they're being proactive in finding mafia, which is a risky move for them.

I'm watching closely to see if they can produce a credible reason for targeting Player 1.]\n[Player 5] [Your move during the next day phase should be to solidify your suspicion on Player 2 and rally support for voting them out.

Their lack of explanation after the night kill makes them highly suspicious. As a Mafia member, I think we should press on this and eliminate Player 2 to secure our victory. I'm going to cast my vote for Player 2.\"** \n\nRemember, as a Mafia member, your goal is to create doubt about an innocent villager while subtly pushing the group to eliminate Player 2. Good luck!**\n[Player 4]  **I agree with the concerns raised about Player 2's silence and their quick vote for Player 1. Their lack of explanation after the night kill makes them highly suspicious.
