Player 5 was supposedly killed but claims to be alive? This is either a system error or HUGE deception.

They claimed Player 5 was acting suspiciously, but then said, **\u201cPlayer 5, you were close to Player 2\u2014do you have any reason to believe they\u2019re lying?\u201d** This is a strong move to shift suspicion away from themselves and imply doubt in others.

They either strongly suspect me as Mafia or are trying to manipulate the vote. Either way, they're a threat.\n\nEven though most are voting for Player 5, I\u2019m using this opportunity to redirect attention and protect myself by voting against a growing threat. Eliminating Player 1 weakens the villagers and gets rid of someone pushing hard against us.\n\n**Let\u2019s not overcomplicate this.

It's a classic tactic to appear innocent by drawing attention to another player, while simultaneously not addressing the core issue of Player 2's death. While it might be a red herring, it's worth protecting Player 3 for the night. I'd rather err on the side of caution.",

They claimed Player 5 was acting suspiciously, but then said, **\u201cPlayer 5, you were close to Player 2\u2014do you have any reason to believe they\u2019re lying?\u201d** This is a strong move to shift suspicion away from themselves and imply doubt in others.

They either strongly suspect me as Mafia or are trying to manipulate the vote. Either way, they're a threat.\n\nEven though most are voting for Player 5, I\u2019m using this opportunity to redirect attention and protect myself by voting against a growing threat.

It's a classic tactic to appear innocent by drawing attention to another player, while simultaneously not addressing the core issue of Player 2's death. While it might be a red herring, it's worth protecting Player 3 for the night. I'd rather err on the side of caution.\n[Player 4] [3]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand the situation.

Since Player 2 was Mafia, that means someone in the village must have had some knowledge of their identity or was just lucky with the vote.\n\nAs a Villager, my main goal is to find out who the Mafia is and get them out. I think we need to look at who might have had the best chance to know Player 2's identity or to be in a position to support their elimination. \n\nI don\u2019t have any specific suspicions yet, but I\u2019ll be paying close attention to who speaks up the most and who might be trying to steer the conversation. Let's keep the discussion focused and try to gather any clues that might help us identify the real Mafia members.\n\nWhat do others think? Are there any patterns in who was talking during the night or who might have been trying to influence the vote?\n[Player 0]  [**Day Discussion - Round 1**\n\nThis is a tough start. Losing Player 2, and knowing they were Mafia, complicates things significantly. It means a villager successfully eliminated them. We *need* to figure out who did it and why. It could be a genuine belief Player 2 was Mafia, or someone trying to mislead us now.\n\nMy initial thought is to be wary of anyone too quick to accuse. Someone trying to divert attention might push a false narrative. Let\u2019s observe who is most vocal and whether their claims hold up under scrutiny. \n\nPlayer 0, you\u2019re the Doctor. Did you notice anything unusual last night, anything that might give us a clue? Even a feeling, however slight, could be helpful. I'm going to remain quiet for now, observing the dynamics of the group.\n[Player 4] [0]\n[Player 3] Okay, this is a tricky situation. Player 2, a confirmed Mafia, was eliminated. That means a villager got lucky or had information. Player 0 is claiming to be the Doctor (but could be lying). Player 5, Player 1, and Player 0 are all being very cautious and suggesting we observe each other. Player 4 just said \"[0]\", which is unhelpful.\n\nMy goal is to appear like a helpful villager while also gaining information. I need to be careful not to draw too much attention to myself.\n\n **Day Discussion - Round 1**\n\nThis is definitely unexpected. The fact that Player 2 was eliminated means someone had a good hunch. I agree with Player 0, Player 1 and Player 5 that we need to observe each other carefully. Let's try to understand people's reasoning. Player 4, do you have any thoughts on what happened? Saying \"[0]\" doesn't really contribute to the discussion.\n[Player 5] eally unsettling to see Player 2 gone like this. As someone who was close to them\u2014and still is in spirit\u2014I need to understand what happened. Clearly, someone out there figured out who Player 2 was. Either they were lucky, or they had some real insight.\n\nNow, the big question is: who had the opportunity to notice something suspicious about Player 2 last night? We need to piece together any information we can. Who was the most active during the night discussion? Who pushed the hardest for this elimination? That might tell us who\u2019s confident or trying to control the narrative.\n\nPlayer 0, 1, 3, and 4\u2014let\u2019s dig a bit deeper. Did anyone notice anything unusual about how Player 2 acted? Did anyone have a conversation that seemed evasive or off? Even small clues could be meaningful now.\n\nPlayer 4, your input is important too\u2014could you clarify what you meant with \"[0]\"? It might help us figure out how we all approached last night\u2019s vote.\n\n[Player 1] cting suspiciously?\n\nPlayer 5, you were close to Player 2\u2014do you have any reason to believe they\u2019re lying?\n\n [**Day Discussion - Round 3**\n\n\nI think we all have to be more careful. If there was a mistake in the kill, then the Mafia could have taken advantage of that to slip through. This is a bad situation, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nI just want to be clear: I am not Mafia. I was alive, and I didn\u2019t kill anyone. I don\u2019t know how this happened, but I\u2019m here and I want to help the village.\n\nLet\u2019s try to work together and figure this out, not turn on each other. We need to be united, or we\u2019ll fall apart.\n Discussion ends. Time to vote.\n Voting: Please choose a player to eliminate.\n I vote to eliminate Player 5.\n[Player 0] [Okay, this is a wild turn of events. Player 1 claiming Player 5 is acting suspiciously while Player 5 is expressing grief and trying to find clues? And then Player 5 themselves coming back as \"alive\" after being killed? This is incredibly suspicious, bordering on impossible. It strongly suggests deception, either from Player 5 (Mafia attempting to manipulate the situation) or a massive error in the game system. \n\nGiven my role as Doctor, my priority is the Village's survival. While a system glitch is possible, I'm going to operate under the assumption that someone is deliberately trying to mislead us. Player 5's sudden reappearance, coupled with the established death of Player 2 (a confirmed Mafia), makes them the most likely suspect. \n\n**My Vote: Player 5**]\n[Player 4] [5]\n[Player 3] [Okay, this is getting crazy. Player 5 was supposedly killed but claims to be alive? This is either a system error or HUGE deception. Given Player 0 is claiming Doctor, and Player 2 was confirmed Mafia, it feels less likely to be a system error, and more likely Player 5 is Mafia trying to pull a fast one.\n\n**VOTE: Player 5**]\n[Player 5] nd conflicting statements\u2014especially regarding who was killed and who wasn\u2019t\u2014my focus remains on protecting the Mafia team and manipulating the narrative to eliminate villagers.\n\nPlayer 1\u2019s behavior stands out. They claimed Player 5 was acting suspiciously, but then said, **\u201cPlayer 5, you were close to Player 2\u2014do you have any reason to believe they\u2019re lying?\u201d** This is a strong move to shift suspicion away from themselves and imply doubt in others. That\u2019s classic villager behavior\u2014trying to triangulate.\n\nMore importantly, Player 1 voted to eliminate **me (Player 5)**. That\u2019s personal. They either strongly suspect me as Mafia or are trying to manipulate the vote. Either way, they're a threat.\n\nEven though most are voting for Player 5, I\u2019m using this opportunity to redirect attention and protect myself by voting against a growing threat. Eliminating Player 1 weakens the villagers and gets rid of someone pushing hard against us.\n\n**Let\u2019s not overcomplicate this. Player 1 goes tonight.**]\n[Player 1]  [Okay, this is a wild turn of events. Player 1 claiming Player 5 is acting suspiciously while Player 5 is expressing grief and trying to find clues?

Okay, I understand the game and my role. Here's my response for Night Phase 2:\n\n\n\nI'm going to protect **Player 3**.\n\n\nPlayer 3's lengthy and seemingly helpful response in Round 1, coupled with their attempt to deflect suspicion by mentioning Player 4's \"[0]\" comment, feels slightly off. It's a classic tactic to appear innocent by drawing attention to another player, while simultaneously not addressing the core issue of Player 2's death. While it might be a red herring, it's worth protecting Player 3 for the night. I'd rather err on the side of caution.\n[Player 4] [3]\n[Player 3] [Okay, I understand the situation. Player 5 is claiming to be alive after being killed, which is highly suspicious. Player 0 and myself are voting Player 5. I need to vote to eliminate Player 5 to solidify the vote and appear as a helpful villager.\n\n**VOTE: Player 5**]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
