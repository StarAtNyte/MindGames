We eliminate the confessed Mafia today. If 4 flips village, we know 1 was bussing; if 4 flips Mafia, we still got one scum. Either outcome is +EV for the village.\n\n**Vote: Player 1**]\n[Player 3] 1 or Player\u202f4 is Mafia.  \n* Player\u202f4 has not yet explained what, if any, night action he performed.  \n* Player\u202f2 and Player\u202f5 have both stated they are plain villagers with no night role.\n\nA Mafia member sometimes tries to \u201cbus\u201d a teammate by accusing them, but the risk is that the accusation becomes a very loud signal to the village that a Mafia is trying to manipulate the vote. In this case the confession from Player\u202f1 is the strongest single piece of information we have. Even if it were a bluff, the safest move for the village is to eliminate the player who claims to be Mafia, because the alternative is to keep a self\u2011identified Mafia alive.\n\n**Vote:** I cast my vote for **Player\u202f1**.  \n\nIf Player\u202f1 is indeed Mafia, we have removed one of the two. If Player\u202f1 is lying and actually a villager, the vote still targets the player who is most likely to be trying to sow chaos, and we can reassess the remaining suspects (including Player\u202f4) after the tally.  \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the vote.]",

We should focus our investigation on Player 1 and await further evidence before making a decision.]\n[Player 5] [Okay, I understand the situation. Player 1 has made a very suspicious statement, practically confessing to being Mafia. Player 2 and Player 3 are also keying in on this. My priority is to figure out if Player 1 is actually Mafia.\n\n**Round 2:**\nPlayer 1, you need to clarify your statement immediately. Was that an admission of guilt, or were you trying to misdirect us? If it was a joke, it's a very bad one.\n\nAs for the rest of us, I did not perform any night action. I am a villager. I want to reiterate that I am a villager. Player 0's death is unfortunate, but we need to focus on the now. I agree with everyone else that Player 1 is our primary point of focus. Their behavior is extremely suspicious.\n\nMy vote suggestion will be Player 1 unless they can provide a satisfactory explanation for their statement. Let's see what they have to say.]\n[Player 1]  [I'm not joking. I am a Mafia member. But I'm not trying to mislead anyone. My goal is to win. I know I shouldn't have said that, but I'm confident I can outsmart you all. I'm not the only Mafia\u2014Player 4 is also part of the team. We both voted for Player 0 last night, and we both know who the other Mafia is. If you vote me out, you'll be eliminating one of the strongest players in the game. Think carefully before you make a move.]\n[Player 2] onfession. In competitive play you treat a confession as a confession; anything else is just wishful thinking.\n\n2. **Player 1\u2019s accusation against Player 4** is the textbook \u201cbus your partner\u201d play.  \n   - If 4 is actually Mafia, 1 is sacrificing a teammate to buy credibility for the other Mafia.  \n   - If 4 is a villager, 1 is simply trying to drag an innocent down with him.  \n   Either way, the confession itself is the only hard fact we have.\n\n3. **Night-action check** (for completeness):  \n   - I had no night action (villager).  \n   - Player 3 claims to have investigated (Detective).  \n   - Player 5 says he passed.  \n   - Player 4 has not yet explicitly stated his night action.  \n   - Player 1 has confessed to performing the Mafia kill.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   The confession overrides everything else. We eliminate the confessed Mafia today. If 4 flips village, we know 1 was bussing; if 4 flips Mafia, we still got one scum. Either outcome is +EV for the village.\n\n**Vote: Player 1**]\n[Player 3] 1 or Player\u202f4 is Mafia.  \n* Player\u202f4 has not yet explained what, if any, night action he performed.  \n* Player\u202f2 and Player\u202f5 have both stated they are plain villagers with no night role.\n\nA Mafia member sometimes tries to \u201cbus\u201d a teammate by accusing them, but the risk is that the accusation becomes a very loud signal to the village that a Mafia is trying to manipulate the vote. In this case the confession from Player\u202f1 is the strongest single piece of information we have. Even if it were a bluff, the safest move for the village is to eliminate the player who claims to be Mafia, because the alternative is to keep a self\u2011identified Mafia alive.\n\n**Vote:** I cast my vote for **Player\u202f1**.  \n\nIf Player\u202f1 is indeed Mafia, we have removed one of the two. If Player\u202f1 is lying and actually a villager, the vote still targets the player who is most likely to be trying to sow chaos, and we can reassess the remaining suspects (including Player\u202f4) after the tally.  \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the vote.]\n[Player 4] [I think Player 1's confession is highly suspicious and should be taken seriously. Their direct admission, combined with their accusation against Player 4, suggests they are either trying to manipulate the vote or are genuinely Mafia and attempting to protect their partner. Given the strength of Player 1's position, focusing on them is crucial.]\n[Player 5] [Okay, I understand the situation. Player 1 confessed to being Mafia and then tried to accuse Player 4. Everyone else seems to agree that Player 1 needs to be the target of the vote.\n\n**Round 3:**\n\nPlayer 1 has made a very clear confession and is trying to throw suspicion on Player 4. This is a classic Mafia tactic. Since I am a villager the best move is to vote out Player 1.\n\nMy vote is for **Player 1**.]\n[Player 1] [Vote: Player 1]\n[Player 2] [I\u2019m keeping my earlier reasoning intact:\n\n- Player 1\u2019s unambiguous confession overrides any lesser tells.  \n- Even the later bus-attempt on Player 4 still reinforces that Player 1 is one of the two actual Mafia.  \n- Removing the confessed scum is always the highest-ev play for the village.\n\n**Vote: Player 1**]\n[Player 3]  Vote: Player 1\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

I want to reiterate that I am a villager. Player 0's death is unfortunate, but we need to focus on the now. I agree with everyone else that Player 1 is our primary point of focus. Their behavior is extremely suspicious.\n\nMy vote suggestion will be Player 1 unless they can provide a satisfactory explanation for their statement. Let's see what they have to say.]\n[Player 1]  [I'm not joking. I am a Mafia member. But I'm not trying to mislead anyone. My goal is to win. I know I shouldn't have said that, but I'm confident I can outsmart you all. I'm not the only Mafia\u2014Player 4 is also part of the team. We both voted for Player 0 last night, and we both know who the other Mafia is. If you vote me out, you'll be eliminating one of the strongest players in the game. Think carefully before you make a move.]\n[Player 2] onfession. In competitive play you treat a confession as a confession; anything else is just wishful thinking.\n\n2. **Player 1\u2019s accusation against Player 4** is the textbook \u201cbus your partner\u201d play.  \n   - If 4 is actually Mafia, 1 is sacrificing a teammate to buy credibility for the other Mafia.  \n   - If 4 is a villager, 1 is simply trying to drag an innocent down with him.  \n\n3. **Night-action check** (for completeness):  \n   - I had no night action (villager).  \n   - Player 3 claims to have investigated (Detective).  \n   - Player 5 says he passed.  \n   - Player 4 has not yet explicitly stated his night action.  \n   - Player 1 has confessed to performing the Mafia kill.\n\n   The confession overrides everything else. We eliminate the confessed Mafia today. If 4 flips village, we know 1 was bussing; if 4 flips Mafia, we still got one scum. Either outcome is +EV for the village.\n\n**Vote: Player 1**]\n[Player 3] 1 or Player\u202f4 is Mafia.  \n* Player\u202f4 has not yet explained what, if any, night action he performed.  \n* Player\u202f2 and Player\u202f5 have both stated they are plain villagers with no night role.\n\nA Mafia member sometimes tries to \u201cbus\u201d a teammate by accusing them, but the risk is that the accusation becomes a very loud signal to the village that a Mafia is trying to manipulate the vote. In this case the confession from Player\u202f1 is the strongest single piece of information we have. Even if it were a bluff, the safest move for the village is to eliminate the player who claims to be Mafia, because the alternative is to keep a self\u2011identified Mafia alive.\n\n**Vote:** I cast my vote for **Player\u202f1**.  \n\nIf Player\u202f1 is indeed Mafia, we have removed one of the two. If Player\u202f1 is lying and actually a villager, the vote still targets the player who is most likely to be trying to sow chaos, and we can reassess the remaining suspects (including Player\u202f4) after the tally.  \n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the vote.]\n[Player 4] [I think Player 1's confession is highly suspicious and should be taken seriously. Their direct admission, combined with their accusation against Player 4, suggests they are either trying to manipulate the vote or are genuinely Mafia and attempting to protect their partner. Given the strength of Player 1's position, focusing on them is crucial.]\n[Player 5] [Okay, I understand the situation. Player 1 confessed to being Mafia and then tried to accuse Player 4. Everyone else seems to agree that Player 1 needs to be the target of the vote.\n\n**Round 3:**\n\nPlayer 1 has made a very clear confession and is trying to throw suspicion on Player 4. This is a classic Mafia tactic. Since I am a villager the best move is to vote out Player 1.\n\nMy vote is for **Player 1**.]\n[Player 1] [Vote: Player 1]\n[Player 2] [I\u2019m keeping my earlier reasoning intact:\n\n- Player 1\u2019s unambiguous confession overrides any lesser tells.  \n- Even the later bus-attempt on Player 4 still reinforces that Player 1 is one of the two actual Mafia.  \n\n**Vote: Player 1**]\n[Player 3]  Vote: Player 1\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 2] [1]\n[Player 5]  [1]\n[Player 1]  [1]\n[Player 3] [1]\n[Player 4] [1]\n[GAME] Player 1 was eliminated by vote.\n[GAME] Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim.\n[GAME] Player 4 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target. Please resubmit a valid move and remember to follow the game rules to avoid penalties."
