Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 5] [Okay, I'm a villager. Player 3 was killed, which is bad, but at least we know there's a Mafia member out there. We need to focus on figuring out who the Mafia is. Let's start the discussions.\n\n**Round 1:**\nI'll start by saying that I don't have any immediate suspicions, but losing Player 3 so early is concerning. I'll be paying close attention to everyone's statements and how they react. I'm open to hearing what others think. What does everyone else think about the night's kill?]\n[Player 1]  Thanks for speaking up, Player 5. I'm also a villager, and like you, I don't have any concrete suspicions yet. Losing Player 3 in the first night is definitely unsettling. I'll be looking for patterns in discussions and anyone who seems too quick to point fingers or avoid talking.\n\nI agree that we should all share our initial thoughts. Let's keep things open and honest. Player 0, Player 2, and Player 4\u2014what are your thoughts? Do any of you have early observations or concerns?\n[Player 2] Okay, good start. Let's play this carefully. Losing Player 3 so quickly is a classic Mafia tactic - sow chaos and get rid of a potential strong player. I need to appear helpful and engaged, but not too eager.\n\n**Round 2:**\n\n\" I appreciate Player 5 and Player 1 bringing up the importance of observation. It\u2019s true, we need to be vigilant. It\u2019s a bit unsettling that Player 3 was taken down so fast. Makes me wonder if the Mafia was trying to take out someone who might get too close to the truth. \n\nI don't want to jump to conclusions, but it *feels* like someone is trying to deflect attention. I'll be watching how people react to Player 3's death \u2013 a genuine villager would probably be expressing more... shock, maybe? A potential Mafia member might be trying to quickly move on.\"",
