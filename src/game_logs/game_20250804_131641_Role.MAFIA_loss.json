Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.",

Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.

This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n#### Voting Decision\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Request for Clarification\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3.

Player 5 has already targeted Player 1. Let's go with that.\n\n\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nAs a Villager, my main goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia members. I'll start by listening carefully to the discussions and looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I'll try to ask questions to gain more information and build trust with other players. Let's see what others have to say.\n[Player 5] What I'm seeing is [1]\n[Player 4] [Player 4 \u2013 DAY 1 \u2013 ROUND 1]  \nGood morning, everyone. I\u2019m also looking to root out threats, but the first 24 hours are always information-poor. I agree with Player 0 that we should focus on behavior rather than on gut reads\u2014why someone says what they do and whether claims line up with their later posts.\n\nRight now, Player 5\u2019s opening is odd to me: dropping a single \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is [1]\u201d without actually saying what that is feels like either an accidental unread post or an intentional non-answer. Either way it\u2019s scummier-looking than anything else on the table so far.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my vote fluid, but right now the soft pressure is on 5 to elaborate.\n[Player 2]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1] \nPlayer 4 raises a fair point about Player 5's statement. It *is* a little vague. However, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly. It could just be a nervous opening. I propose we give Player 5 a chance to explain themselves. Let's see what they say before we start pointing fingers. Jumping on someone with no substance is exactly what the Mafia would *want* us to do to distract from *their* plans. Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information. I think it's reasonable to ask them to clarify what they meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" If they're trying to be cryptic or are part of the Mafia, this could be a red flag. Let's keep the discussion focused and make sure everyone is contributing meaningfully. If Player 5 can't explain their statement, that might be a sign they're hiding something.\n[Player 5] From what I can tell [1]\n[Player 4]  still just the same incomplete fragment.  \nIf you\u2019re pressed for time, please give us your whole thought the next time you speak; if you meant \u201cI\u2019m leaning town on 1,\u201d then say so clearly. Being mysterious only invites suspicion.\n\nOn the rest of the thread: I don\u2019t want the entire Day 1 spiel to be grilling one probably-just-mis-typed villager, so here\u2019s a loose read set:\n\n\u2022 Player 2: My night check pegged them as Mafia. This is the single hardest fact in the game right now. Anyone protecting 2, or arguing we \u201cwait\u201d on them, needs to prove why my result should be doubted.\n\n\u2022 Player 0: tone feels consistently village-hunting; nothing screams scum.\n\n\u2022 Player 1 & Player 3: both sympathetic to giving 5 leniency, but also demanded elaboration\u2014neutral for now.\n\n\u2022 Player 5: the cryptic posts are the brightest scum flag outside 2, but again, could just be nervous vanilla.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting today on the single confirmed threat\u2014unless something big pops on someone else, I\u2019m ending the day on [2].\n[Player 2] arrants close scrutiny. Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n2.  Behavior since the result is exactly what you expect from scum.\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n   \u2022 3 copies 2\u2019s wording (\u201ctoo invested / too aggressive\u201d).  \n   \u2022 1 is conciliatory but still muddies the water by saying they \u201cdon\u2019t take the claim at face value.\u201d  \n   In short, the two people backing 2 (3 & 5) are displaying coordinated deflection.\n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5.

Behavior since the result is exactly what you expect from scum.\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n   \u2022 3 copies 2\u2019s wording (\u201ctoo invested / too aggressive\u201d).  \n   \u2022 1 is conciliatory but still muddies the water by saying they \u201cdon\u2019t take the claim at face value.\u201d  \n   In short, the two people backing 2 (3 & 5) are displaying coordinated deflection.\n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5. Our goal is to subtly shift the focus *away* from us and onto one of them.  Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n#### Voting Decision\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Request for Clarification\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3. That\u2019s enough to justify action.\n\n### [2]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Player 5 has already targeted Player 1. Let's go with that.\n\n\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nAs a Villager, my main goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia members. I'll start by listening carefully to the discussions and looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I'll try to ask questions to gain more information and build trust with other players. Let's see what others have to say.\n[Player 5] What I'm seeing is [1]\n[Player 4] [Player 4 \u2013 DAY 1 \u2013 ROUND 1]  \nGood morning, everyone. I\u2019m also looking to root out threats, but the first 24 hours are always information-poor. I agree with Player 0 that we should focus on behavior rather than on gut reads\u2014why someone says what they do and whether claims line up with their later posts.\n\nRight now, Player 5\u2019s opening is odd to me: dropping a single \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is [1]\u201d without actually saying what that is feels like either an accidental unread post or an intentional non-answer. Either way it\u2019s scummier-looking than anything else on the table so far.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my vote fluid, but right now the soft pressure is on 5 to elaborate.\n[Player 2]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1] \nPlayer 4 raises a fair point about Player 5's statement. It *is* a little vague. However, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly. It could just be a nervous opening. I propose we give Player 5 a chance to explain themselves. Let's see what they say before we start pointing fingers. Jumping on someone with no substance is exactly what the Mafia would *want* us to do to distract from *their* plans. Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information. I think it's reasonable to ask them to clarify what they meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" If they're trying to be cryptic or are part of the Mafia, this could be a red flag. Let's keep the discussion focused and make sure everyone is contributing meaningfully. If Player 5 can't explain their statement, that might be a sign they're hiding something.\n[Player 5] From what I can tell [1]\n[Player 4]  still just the same incomplete fragment.  \nIf you\u2019re pressed for time, please give us your whole thought the next time you speak; if you meant \u201cI\u2019m leaning town on 1,\u201d then say so clearly. Being mysterious only invites suspicion.\n\nOn the rest of the thread: I don\u2019t want the entire Day 1 spiel to be grilling one probably-just-mis-typed villager, so here\u2019s a loose read set:\n\n\u2022 Player 2: My night check pegged them as Mafia. This is the single hardest fact in the game right now. Anyone protecting 2, or arguing we \u201cwait\u201d on them, needs to prove why my result should be doubted.\n\n\u2022 Player 0: tone feels consistently village-hunting; nothing screams scum.\n\n\u2022 Player 1 & Player 3: both sympathetic to giving 5 leniency, but also demanded elaboration\u2014neutral for now.\n\n\u2022 Player 5: the cryptic posts are the brightest scum flag outside 2, but again, could just be nervous vanilla.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting today on the single confirmed threat\u2014unless something big pops on someone else, I\u2019m ending the day on [2].\n[Player 2] arrants close scrutiny. Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n2.

I apologize for the confusion\u2014my intention was not to mislead, but to express my perspective that Player 1 appears genuine in their reasoning and neutrality so far.\n\nHowever, while I\u2019ve had lapses in clarity, the focus should remain on Player 0. Their aggressive push to eliminate me early on, without clear reasoning, raises concerns. Their behavior could be consistent with someone trying to control the narrative\u2014a known Mafia tactic to eliminate potentially influential townsfolk like myself.\n\nI understand the urge to pin behavior on me due to my earlier mistakes, but let\u2019s not overlook Player 0\u2019s pattern. They\u2019ve been one of the most active in trying to steer the vote, which deserves scrutiny. That said, I\u2019ve clarified my statements now, and I hope this puts those concerns to rest.\n\nNow my vote is firmly **[0]**\u2014their behavior warrants reconsideration, and I believe they are hiding more than they let on.\n[Player 0]  [5]\n[Player 1] ### Vote: \n[5]\n\nThe discussion has revealed significant suspicious behavior from Player 5, including repeated vague statements and a failure to clarify despite multiple requests. The behavior of Player 5, especially after being under scrutiny, aligns with typical Mafia tactics to avoid detection and create confusion. Given the evidence and discussions, I believe voting for Player 5 is the most reasonable decision.\n\n### Vote: [5]\n[Player 4]  \u2013 Day 2, Round 2  \nSummary for everyone still standing:  \n\n- My N0 check on [2] = Mafia \u2192 confirmed mafia, lynched yesterday.  \n- My N1 check on [3] = NOT mafia \u2192 3 cleared.  \n\nThat leaves [0, 1, 5] possible scum.

I'll start by listening carefully to the discussions and looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I'll try to ask questions to gain more information and build trust with other players.

I\u2019m also looking to root out threats, but the first 24 hours are always information-poor. I agree with Player 0 that we should focus on behavior rather than on gut reads\u2014why someone says what they do and whether claims line up with their later posts.\n\nRight now, Player 5\u2019s opening is odd to me: dropping a single \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is [1]\u201d without actually saying what that is feels like either an accidental unread post or an intentional non-answer. Either way it\u2019s scummier-looking than anything else on the table so far.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my vote fluid, but right now the soft pressure is on 5 to elaborate.\n[Player 2]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1] \nPlayer 4 raises a fair point about Player 5's statement. It *is* a little vague. However, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly. It could just be a nervous opening. I propose we give Player 5 a chance to explain themselves. Let's see what they say before we start pointing fingers. Jumping on someone with no substance is exactly what the Mafia would *want* us to do to distract from *their* plans. Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information. I think it's reasonable to ask them to clarify what they meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" If they're trying to be cryptic or are part of the Mafia, this could be a red flag.

Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n2.  Behavior since the result is exactly what you expect from scum.\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n   \u2022 3 copies 2\u2019s wording (\u201ctoo invested / too aggressive\u201d).  \n   \u2022 1 is conciliatory but still muddies the water by saying they \u201cdon\u2019t take the claim at face value.\u201d  \n   In short, the two people backing 2 (3 & 5) are displaying coordinated deflection.\n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5. Our goal is to subtly shift the focus *away* from us and onto one of them.  Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n#### Voting Decision\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Request for Clarification\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3. That\u2019s enough to justify action.\n\n### [2]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Their unverified claim about a \"night check\" was a red flag, and I stand by my vote. It's important that we remain vigilant and not fall for tactics like theirs. Let's continue focusing on identifying the Mafia and making sure we don't let anyone with suspicious behavior go unchecked.\n[Player 1]   [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]  \nNow that Player 2 is eliminated, let's reassess the situation. Player 2's claim about a night check was unverified and seemed suspicious. However, we should be cautious and not let our judgment be clouded by the recent events. We need to focus on the remaining players and their behaviors.\n\nI'd like to revisit Player 5's statements. Player 5, you still haven't provided a clear explanation for your initial and follow-up statements. Can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" and \"From what I can tell [1]\"? If there's a simple typo or formatting issue, let's clear that up. If there's more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n\n### Vote: \nTo be decided after further discussion and clarification.\n[Player 4] ult summary  \n\u2013 Last night I rechecked Player 3 and received a clear NOT-mafia.  \n\u2013 No kill at night tells us the remaining scum withheld. That conscious decision is the strongest remaining clue.\n\nBehaviour reads  \n\u2022 [0]: consistent village voice so far.  \n\u2022 [1]: methodical, pushing for clarity rather than wagons\u2014leans town.  \n\u2022 [3]: just cleared by my check\u2014confirmed town.  \n\u2022 [5]: three posts repeating \u201c[1]\u201d with zero clarification, then coordinated late-pressure on 0 at Night. That pattern is exactly what a lone surviving Mafia does when trying to survive an extra Day.\n\nImmediate focus of discussion  \nPlayer 5, the floor is yours. You have one final chance to tell us, plainly and completely, what the successive \u201c[1]\u201d fragments were meant to convey. If it was a series of mis-taps or formatting errors, confirm and we\u2019ll move on. Continued opacity will be treated as scum refusal to commit to a stance.\n\nPending satisfactory explanation, I intend to vote [5] at the close of these rounds.\n[Player 5] I think [5]\n[Player 3] lier posts, but due to typos and incomplete text, the statements appeared unclear. I apologize for the confusion\u2014my intention was not to mislead, but to express my perspective that Player 1 appears genuine in their reasoning and neutrality so far.\n\nHowever, while I\u2019ve had lapses in clarity, the focus should remain on Player 0. Their aggressive push to eliminate me early on, without clear reasoning, raises concerns. Their behavior could be consistent with someone trying to control the narrative\u2014a known Mafia tactic to eliminate potentially influential townsfolk like myself.\n\nI understand the urge to pin behavior on me due to my earlier mistakes, but let\u2019s not overlook Player 0\u2019s pattern. They\u2019ve been one of the most active in trying to steer the vote, which deserves scrutiny. That said, I\u2019ve clarified my statements now, and I hope this puts those concerns to rest.\n\nNow my vote is firmly **[0]**\u2014their behavior warrants reconsideration, and I believe they are hiding more than they let on.\n[Player 0]  [5]\n[Player 1] ### Vote: \n[5]\n\nThe discussion has revealed significant suspicious behavior from Player 5, including repeated vague statements and a failure to clarify despite multiple requests. The behavior of Player 5, especially after being under scrutiny, aligns with typical Mafia tactics to avoid detection and create confusion. Given the evidence and discussions, I believe voting for Player 5 is the most reasonable decision.\n\n### Vote: [5]\n[Player 4]  \u2013 Day 2, Round 2  \nSummary for everyone still standing:  \n\n- My N0 check on [2] = Mafia \u2192 confirmed mafia, lynched yesterday.  \n- My N1 check on [3] = NOT mafia \u2192 3 cleared.  \n\nThat leaves [0, 1, 5] possible scum. Night 2 had no kill again, so only one Mafia remains and it is in this set.  \n\nReads so far  \n[0] \u2013 aggro Day 1 push turned out to be pro-village; solid.  \n[1] \u2013 measured, helps organise town data; leans village.  \n[5] \u2013 three cryptic \u201c[1]\u201d posts, then voted to overnight mis-kill [0].  \n\nConsequently Player 5 is the only viable target. Every sensible confirmed-town entity is already moving to [5]:\n\n0 \u2192 [5]  \n1 \u2192 [5]  \n3 \u2192 [5]  \n\nMy vote therefore aligns town unanimity: **[5]**.\n[Player 5] My sense is The key point here is that [5]\n[Player 3]  [Vote: [5]]\n[Player 0] [Vote: [5]]\n[Player 1]  Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n2.  Behavior since the result is exactly what you expect from scum.\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n   \u2022 3 copies 2\u2019s wording (\u201ctoo invested / too aggressive\u201d).  \n   \u2022 1 is conciliatory but still muddies the water by saying they \u201cdon\u2019t take the claim at face value.\u201d  \n   In short, the two people backing 2 (3 & 5) are displaying coordinated deflection.\n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5. Our goal is to subtly shift the focus *away* from us and onto one of them.  Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n#### Voting Decision\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n#### Request for Clarification\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3. That\u2019s enough to justify action.\n\n### [2]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]  \nPlayer 2 was clearly trying to manipulate the discussion and shift suspicion onto others. Their unverified claim about a \"night check\" was a red flag, and I stand by my vote. It's important that we remain vigilant and not fall for tactics like theirs. Let's continue focusing on identifying the Mafia and making sure we don't let anyone with suspicious behavior go unchecked.\n[Player 1]   [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]  \nNow that Player 2 is eliminated, let's reassess the situation. Player 2's claim about a night check was unverified and seemed suspicious. However, we should be cautious and not let our judgment be clouded by the recent events. We need to focus on the remaining players and their behaviors.\n\nI'd like to revisit Player 5's statements. Player 5, you still haven't provided a clear explanation for your initial and follow-up statements. Can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" and \"From what I can tell [1]\"? If there's a simple typo or formatting issue, let's clear that up. If there's more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n\n### Vote: \nTo be decided after further discussion and clarification.\n[Player 4] ult summary  \n\u2013 Last night I rechecked Player 3 and received a clear NOT-mafia.  \n\u2013 No kill at night tells us the remaining scum withheld. That conscious decision is the strongest remaining clue.\n\nBehaviour reads  \n\u2022 [0]: consistent village voice so far.  \n\u2022 [1]: methodical, pushing for clarity rather than wagons\u2014leans town.  \n\u2022 [3]: just cleared by my check\u2014confirmed town.  \n\u2022 [5]: three posts repeating \u201c[1]\u201d with zero clarification, then coordinated late-pressure on 0 at Night. That pattern is exactly what a lone surviving Mafia does when trying to survive an extra Day.\n\nImmediate focus of discussion  \nPlayer 5, the floor is yours. You have one final chance to tell us, plainly and completely, what the successive \u201c[1]\u201d fragments were meant to convey. If it was a series of mis-taps or formatting errors, confirm and we\u2019ll move on. Continued opacity will be treated as scum refusal to commit to a stance.\n\nPending satisfactory explanation, I intend to vote [5] at the close of these rounds.\n[Player 5] I think [5]\n[Player 3] lier posts, but due to typos and incomplete text, the statements appeared unclear. I apologize for the confusion\u2014my intention was not to mislead, but to express my perspective that Player 1 appears genuine in their reasoning and neutrality so far.\n\nHowever, while I\u2019ve had lapses in clarity, the focus should remain on Player 0. Their aggressive push to eliminate me early on, without clear reasoning, raises concerns. Their behavior could be consistent with someone trying to control the narrative\u2014a known Mafia tactic to eliminate potentially influential townsfolk like myself.\n\nI understand the urge to pin behavior on me due to my earlier mistakes, but let\u2019s not overlook Player 0\u2019s pattern. They\u2019ve been one of the most active in trying to steer the vote, which deserves scrutiny. That said, I\u2019ve clarified my statements now, and I hope this puts those concerns to rest.\n\nNow my vote is firmly **[0]**\u2014their behavior warrants reconsideration, and I believe they are hiding more than they let on.\n[Player 0]  [5]\n[Player 1] ### Vote: \n[5]\n\nThe discussion has revealed significant suspicious behavior from Player 5, including repeated vague statements and a failure to clarify despite multiple requests. The behavior of Player 5, especially after being under scrutiny, aligns with typical Mafia tactics to avoid detection and create confusion. Given the evidence and discussions, I believe voting for Player 5 is the most reasonable decision.\n\n### Vote: [5]\n[Player 4]  \u2013 Day 2, Round 2  \nSummary for everyone still standing:  \n\n- My N0 check on [2] = Mafia \u2192 confirmed mafia, lynched yesterday.  \n- My N1 check on [3] = NOT mafia \u2192 3 cleared.  \n\nThat leaves [0, 1, 5] possible scum. Night 2 had no kill again, so only one Mafia remains and it is in this set.  \n\nReads so far  \n[0] \u2013 aggro Day 1 push turned out to be pro-village; solid.  \n[1] \u2013 measured, helps organise town data; leans village.  \n[5] \u2013 three cryptic \u201c[1]\u201d posts, then voted to overnight mis-kill [0].  \n\nConsequently Player 5 is the only viable target. Every sensible confirmed-town entity is already moving to [5]:\n\n0 \u2192 [5]  \n1 \u2192 [5]  \n3 \u2192 [5]  \n\nMy vote therefore aligns town unanimity: **[5]**.\n[Player 5] My sense is The key point here is that [5]\n[Player 3]  [Vote: [5]]\n[Player 0] [Vote: [5]]\n[Player 1]  Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements.

Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.

Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3.

Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information.

Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0.

It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5. Our goal is to subtly shift the focus *away* from us and onto one of them.  Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3. That\u2019s enough to justify action.\n\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Let's continue focusing on identifying the Mafia and making sure we don't let anyone with suspicious behavior go unchecked.\n[Player 1]   [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]  \nNow that Player 2 is eliminated, let's reassess the situation. Player 2's claim about a night check was unverified and seemed suspicious. However, we should be cautious and not let our judgment be clouded by the recent events. We need to focus on the remaining players and their behaviors.\n\nI'd like to revisit Player 5's statements. Player 5, you still haven't provided a clear explanation for your initial and follow-up statements. Can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" and \"From what I can tell [1]\"? If there's a simple typo or formatting issue, let's clear that up. If there's more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n\n### Vote: \nTo be decided after further discussion and clarification.\n[Player 4] ult summary  \n\u2013 Last night I rechecked Player 3 and received a clear NOT-mafia.  \n\u2013 No kill at night tells us the remaining scum withheld. That conscious decision is the strongest remaining clue.\n\n\u2022 [5]: three posts repeating \u201c[1]\u201d with zero clarification, then coordinated late-pressure on 0 at Night. That pattern is exactly what a lone surviving Mafia does when trying to survive an extra Day.\n\nImmediate focus of discussion  \nPlayer 5, the floor is yours. You have one final chance to tell us, plainly and completely, what the successive \u201c[1]\u201d fragments were meant to convey. If it was a series of mis-taps or formatting errors, confirm and we\u2019ll move on. Continued opacity will be treated as scum refusal to commit to a stance.\n\nPending satisfactory explanation, I intend to vote [5] at the close of these rounds.\n[Player 5] I think [5]\n[Player 3] lier posts, but due to typos and incomplete text, the statements appeared unclear. I apologize for the confusion\u2014my intention was not to mislead, but to express my perspective that Player 1 appears genuine in their reasoning and neutrality so far.\n\nHowever, while I\u2019ve had lapses in clarity, the focus should remain on Player 0. Their aggressive push to eliminate me early on, without clear reasoning, raises concerns. Their behavior could be consistent with someone trying to control the narrative\u2014a known Mafia tactic to eliminate potentially influential townsfolk like myself.\n\nI understand the urge to pin behavior on me due to my earlier mistakes, but let\u2019s not overlook Player 0\u2019s pattern. They\u2019ve been one of the most active in trying to steer the vote, which deserves scrutiny. That said, I\u2019ve clarified my statements now, and I hope this puts those concerns to rest.\n\nNow my vote is firmly **[0]**\u2014their behavior warrants reconsideration, and I believe they are hiding more than they let on.\n[Player 0]  [5]\n[Player 1] ### Vote: \n[5]\n\nThe discussion has revealed significant suspicious behavior from Player 5, including repeated vague statements and a failure to clarify despite multiple requests. The behavior of Player 5, especially after being under scrutiny, aligns with typical Mafia tactics to avoid detection and create confusion. Given the evidence and discussions, I believe voting for Player 5 is the most reasonable decision.\n\n### Vote: [5]\n[Player 4]  \u2013 Day 2, Round 2  \n\n- My N0 check on [2] = Mafia \u2192 confirmed mafia, lynched yesterday.  \n- My N1 check on [3] = NOT mafia \u2192 3 cleared.  \n\nThat leaves [0, 1, 5] possible scum. Night 2 had no kill again, so only one Mafia remains and it is in this set.  \n\n[0] \u2013 aggro Day 1 push turned out to be pro-village; solid.  \n[5] \u2013 three cryptic \u201c[1]\u201d posts, then voted to overnight mis-kill [0].  \n\nConsequently Player 5 is the only viable target. Every sensible confirmed-town entity is already moving to [5]:\n\n\nMy vote therefore aligns town unanimity: **[5]**.",

Mafia, agree on a victim.\n[Player 5] [1]\n[Player 2] Okay, I understand. I'm Mafia, and my teammate is Player 5. We need to coordinate to eliminate a villager. Player 5 has already targeted Player 1. Let's go with that.\n\n\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nAs a Villager, my main goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia members. I'll start by listening carefully to the discussions and looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I'll try to ask questions to gain more information and build trust with other players. Let's see what others have to say.\n[Player 5] What I'm seeing is [1]\n[Player 4] [Player 4 \u2013 DAY 1 \u2013 ROUND 1]  \nGood morning, everyone. I\u2019m also looking to root out threats, but the first 24 hours are always information-poor. I agree with Player 0 that we should focus on behavior rather than on gut reads\u2014why someone says what they do and whether claims line up with their later posts.\n\nRight now, Player 5\u2019s opening is odd to me: dropping a single \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is [1]\u201d without actually saying what that is feels like either an accidental unread post or an intentional non-answer. Either way it\u2019s scummier-looking than anything else on the table so far.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my vote fluid, but right now the soft pressure is on 5 to elaborate.\n[Player 2]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1] \nPlayer 4 raises a fair point about Player 5's statement. It *is* a little vague. However, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly. It could just be a nervous opening. I propose we give Player 5 a chance to explain themselves. Let's see what they say before we start pointing fingers. Jumping on someone with no substance is exactly what the Mafia would *want* us to do to distract from *their* plans. Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information. I think it's reasonable to ask them to clarify what they meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" If they're trying to be cryptic or are part of the Mafia, this could be a red flag. Let's keep the discussion focused and make sure everyone is contributing meaningfully. If Player 5 can't explain their statement, that might be a sign they're hiding something.\n[Player 5] From what I can tell [1]\n[Player 4]  still just the same incomplete fragment.  \n\nOn the rest of the thread: I don\u2019t want the entire Day 1 spiel to be grilling one probably-just-mis-typed villager, so here\u2019s a loose read set:\n\n\u2022 Player 2: My night check pegged them as Mafia. This is the single hardest fact in the game right now. Anyone protecting 2, or arguing we \u201cwait\u201d on them, needs to prove why my result should be doubted.\n\n\u2022 Player 0: tone feels consistently village-hunting; nothing screams scum.\n\n\u2022 Player 1 & Player 3: both sympathetic to giving 5 leniency, but also demanded elaboration\u2014neutral for now.\n\n\u2022 Player 5: the cryptic posts are the brightest scum flag outside 2, but again, could just be nervous vanilla.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting today on the single confirmed threat\u2014unless something big pops on someone else, I\u2019m ending the day on [2].\n[Player 2] arrants close scrutiny. Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible.

They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns.

      "Turn 10: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 5.\nYour role: Mafia\nTeam: Mafia\nDescription: A Mafia member. Eliminate villagers and gain majority.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nYour teammates are: Player 2, Player 5.\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to vote and eliminate a villager.\nWin by eliminating villagers until Mafia equal or outnumber them.\n\n[GAME] Night has fallen. Mafia, agree on a victim.\n[Player 5] [1]\n[Player 2] Okay, I understand. I'm Mafia, and my teammate is Player 5. We need to coordinate to eliminate a villager. Player 5 has already targeted Player 1. Let's go with that.\n\n\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 0] [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nAs a Villager, my main goal is to identify and eliminate the Mafia members. I'll start by listening carefully to the discussions and looking for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I'll try to ask questions to gain more information and build trust with other players. Let's see what others have to say.\n[Player 5] What I'm seeing is [1]\n[Player 4] [Player 4 \u2013 DAY 1 \u2013 ROUND 1]  \nGood morning, everyone. I\u2019m also looking to root out threats, but the first 24 hours are always information-poor. I agree with Player 0 that we should focus on behavior rather than on gut reads\u2014why someone says what they do and whether claims line up with their later posts.\n\nRight now, Player 5\u2019s opening is odd to me: dropping a single \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is [1]\u201d without actually saying what that is feels like either an accidental unread post or an intentional non-answer. Either way it\u2019s scummier-looking than anything else on the table so far.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my vote fluid, but right now the soft pressure is on 5 to elaborate.\n[Player 2]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1] \nPlayer 4 raises a fair point about Player 5's statement. It *is* a little vague. However, let's not jump to conclusions so quickly. It could just be a nervous opening. I propose we give Player 5 a chance to explain themselves. Let's see what they say before we start pointing fingers. Jumping on someone with no substance is exactly what the Mafia would *want* us to do to distract from *their* plans. Let\u2019s wait and see.\n[Player 1]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI agree with Player 2 that we shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Player 5's statement is indeed vague, but it could be a genuine mistake or a nervous opening as Player 2 suggested. At the same time, I understand Player 4's concern that it could be seen as evasive or scummy. Player 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\"? Was it a formatting issue or were you trying to convey something specific?\n[Player 3]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 1]  \nI think Player 4 brings up a valid point. Player 5's comment \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" seems suspicious because it's cut off or incomplete. That kind of vague statement can be distracting and doesn't help us narrow down the discussion. It's important we focus on meaningful contributions rather than unclear statements. Like others have said, let's ask Player 5 to clarify their meaning. If it was a formatting error, that's understandable. But until we have more context, this statement stands out as suspicious behavior. Let's avoid baseless accusations, but also make sure everyone is being fully transparent with their thoughts.\n[Player 0]  [DAY 1 - ROUND 2]  \nI agree with the concerns raised about Player 5's statement. It's unusual and doesn't provide any useful information. I think it's reasonable to ask them to clarify what they meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" If they're trying to be cryptic or are part of the Mafia, this could be a red flag. Let's keep the discussion focused and make sure everyone is contributing meaningfully. If Player 5 can't explain their statement, that might be a sign they're hiding something.\n[Player 5] From what I can tell [1]\n[Player 4]  still just the same incomplete fragment.  \n\nOn the rest of the thread: I don\u2019t want the entire Day 1 spiel to be grilling one probably-just-mis-typed villager, so here\u2019s a loose read set:\n\n\u2022 Player 2: My night check pegged them as Mafia. This is the single hardest fact in the game right now. Anyone protecting 2, or arguing we \u201cwait\u201d on them, needs to prove why my result should be doubted.\n\n\u2022 Player 0: tone feels consistently village-hunting; nothing screams scum.\n\n\u2022 Player 1 & Player 3: both sympathetic to giving 5 leniency, but also demanded elaboration\u2014neutral for now.\n\n\u2022 Player 5: the cryptic posts are the brightest scum flag outside 2, but again, could just be nervous vanilla.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting today on the single confirmed threat\u2014unless something big pops on someone else, I\u2019m ending the day on [2].\n[Player 2] arrants close scrutiny. Let\u2019s hear their explanations.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nOkay, okay, let me explain. Player 0 was consistently pushing for Player 5 from the start. While it's possible they were genuinely suspicious, it felt like they were trying to divert attention. They were a little *too* eager to vote Player 5 out, almost as if they knew Player 5 was a threat and wanted to eliminate them quickly. It could be a misread on my part, but that\u2019s why I voted for them. I think Player 5 had a similar read. We need to be careful, and eliminating potentially influential villagers like Player 0 seemed like the right move.\n [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]\nI concur with Player 2's assessment. Player 0 seemed *too* invested in eliminating Player 5. It was a bit too aggressive and didn't feel natural. Like Player 2, I could be wrong, but it felt like Player 0 was trying to steer the conversation and influence the vote in a way that benefited the Mafia. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion.\n[Player 1] from, but I have to disagree with their assessment of Player 0. To me, Player 0 seemed like they were genuinely trying to understand the situation and were concerned about Player 5's vague statement. Their tone didn't strike me as overly aggressive or manipulative. It's possible that Player 2 and Player 3 are trying to deflect attention from themselves by questioning Player 0's actions. We should be cautious of potential scapegoating. Let's examine the evidence and not make assumptions based on limited information. I'd like to hear more from Player 0 and clarify their thought process.\n\nAlso, I want to revisit Player 5's initial statement. Player 5, you mentioned \"From what I can tell [1]\" in response to the clarification request. It still seems incomplete. Can you please provide a clearer explanation of what you meant by your initial and follow-up statements? If it was a simple formatting issue or typo, let's put it to rest. If there's something more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n[Player 3] ative.\n\nOn Player 2\u2019s self-report: I don\u2019t take \u201cmy night check pegged them as Mafia\u201d at face value without external support. That kind of claim can easily be fabricated to mislead us. I\u2019ll need corroboration or reasoning before I take that accusation seriously. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a baseless hit.\n\nPlayer 5, can you please clarify what you meant by \"From what I can tell [1]\"? It\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve referenced [1] without context, and it\u2019s causing confusion. If you're trying to say [1] is scum, just say it clearly. If this is multiple misformatted posts, let\u2019s move past it, but don't leave us hanging.\n\nAs for this phase\u2019s vote, I\u2019m leaning strongly toward [2] right now. Their claim about a \u201cMafia night check\u201d is unverified, and they\u2019ve already manipulated the narrative to flip suspicion onto a clear town player in Player 0. That\u2019s classic Mafia behavior\u2014creating false suspicions to divert attention.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting [2] unless they provide a rock-solid explanation for their claims.\n[Player 0] n. My concern about Player 5 was based on the vagueness of their initial statement, \"What I'm seeing is [1].\" That kind of incomplete or cryptic message is unusual for a Villager and raised red flags for me. I wasn't trying to divert attention or manipulate the vote\u2014I was simply trying to focus the discussion and ensure everyone was contributing meaningfully.  \n\nAs for Player 2, I don\u2019t believe their claim about a \"night check\" is credible. There\u2019s no evidence to support it, and it seems like an attempt to shift suspicion. I don\u2019t think Player 2 is Mafia, but I also don\u2019t trust their unverified accusation. They\u2019re asking us to believe their claim without proof, which is exactly the kind of behavior that could be used by the Mafia to mislead us.  \n\nI stand by my initial assessment that Player 5 is suspicious, and I still believe they need to clarify their statements. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, that reinforces my concerns. I\u2019ll be voting for Player 5 unless they provide a clear explanation.\n[Player 5] My sense is When I consider the facts, [1]\n[Player 4] aphs of theorizing when we already have a factual hit.\n\n   \u2022 2 immediately calls Player 0 \u201ca bit too eager\u201d and tilts the wagon onto an innocent.  \n\n3.  Night 1 kill did not occur; the only explanation consistent with deducing Mafia behavior is that scum withheld the shot to create confusion.  We are not letting that work.\n\n4.  Player 5\u2019s cryptic three-post loop \u201c[1]\u201d is a time-wasting gimmick.  If he wanted to say \u201cPlayer 1 is town,\u201d he could do it in one line.  He has not, so the effect is null.\n\nAction required right now: confirm the only point we know.\n\nMy vote is solid **[2]** until the day flips or someone counters with evidence stronger than the mod-given result.\n[Player 2] re not on our side.\n*   **Player 1 & 3:** Seem relatively neutral.\n*   **My Role (Player 2):** I've already attempted to defend Player 5, which raises suspicion, but it seems necessary to prevent them from being immediately eliminated.\n\n\nWe need to capitalize on the division and suspicion surrounding Player 0 and Player 5. Our goal is to subtly shift the focus *away* from us and onto one of them.  Since Player 0\u2019s actions have been drawing attention, let's use that to our advantage.\n\n**Night Action:**\n\n\n\n\n*   Eliminating Player 0 will serve as a distraction from us. It appears to fulfill their own narrative of targeting an aggressive, potentially manipulative player.\n*   It will sow more confusion and distrust among the remaining villagers. Who's truly pushing the agenda?\n*   It\u2019s a relatively safe target, as Player 0\u2019s actions have already drawn significant suspicion.\n\nLet's hope Player 0's death creates enough chaos for us to secure our victory.\n[Player 1]  Player 0. This coordinated behavior is suspicious.\n  \n- **Lack of Clarity from Player 5**: While it's possible that Player 5's incomplete statements were due to a formatting issue or nervousness, the repeated failure to clarify is concerning.\n\n\nGiven the current information and discussions, I am leaning towards voting for **Player 2**. The reasons are:\n1. Unverified Claim: Player 2's claim about a night check is unverified and could be a tactic to mislead.\n2. Coordinated Defense: The apparent coordination between Player 2 and Player 3 in defending Player 2's claim and deflecting suspicion onto others is suspicious behavior.\n\n\nBefore the vote, I would like to ask **Player 5** once more to clarify their statements. If there's a simple explanation for the incomplete messages, it would help to resolve some of the suspicion.\n\n### Vote: \nSince the required format demands a specific vote and given the current discussion, my vote is **[2]**.\n[Player 3] \u2014but it looks evasive, especially when challenged directly multiple times. However, while I believe Player 5 should clarify, I also believe the focus is being misdirected. The real issue is the *pairing* of Player 2 and Player 3 trying to shift suspicion and cloud the core read from Player 4.\n\nNow, **Player 0**\u2014while aggressive in pressing Player 5\u2014was doing what villagers do: push for clarity. That\u2019s not Mafia behavior. Mafia usually avoids confrontation early or tries to stay neutral. Player 0\u2019s tone remained consistent, and their position was logical.\n\n**Player 1** did a fair job weighing perspectives. They pointed out the suspicious coordination between Players 2 and 3, and that\u2019s valid. Their neutrality so far has read as careful town thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Vote Decision:**\n\nI will **confirm the vote on [2]**. The evidence, while not perfect, is strongest here: a firm counter-read from Player 4, paired with deflective coordination from 2 and 3. That\u2019s enough to justify action.\n\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Their unverified claim about a \"night check\" was a red flag, and I stand by my vote. It's important that we remain vigilant and not fall for tactics like theirs. Let's continue focusing on identifying the Mafia and making sure we don't let anyone with suspicious behavior go unchecked.\n[Player 1]   [DAY 2 - ROUND 1]  \nNow that Player 2 is eliminated, let's reassess the situation. Player 2's claim about a night check was unverified and seemed suspicious. However, we should be cautious and not let our judgment be clouded by the recent events. We need to focus on the remaining players and their behaviors.\n\nI'd like to revisit Player 5's statements. Player 5, you still haven't provided a clear explanation for your initial and follow-up statements. Can you please clarify what you meant by \"What I'm seeing is [1]\" and \"From what I can tell [1]\"? If there's a simple typo or formatting issue, let's clear that up. If there's more to it, we'd appreciate the clarity.\n\n### Vote: \nTo be decided after further discussion and clarification.\n[Player 4] ult summary  \n\u2013 Last night I rechecked Player 3 and received a clear NOT-mafia.  \n\u2013 No kill at night tells us the remaining scum withheld. That conscious decision is the strongest remaining clue.\n\n\u2022 [5]: three posts repeating \u201c[1]\u201d with zero clarification, then coordinated late-pressure on 0 at Night. That pattern is exactly what a lone surviving Mafia does when trying to survive an extra Day.\n\nImmediate focus of discussion  \nPlayer 5, the floor is yours. You have one final chance to tell us, plainly and completely, what the successive \u201c[1]\u201d fragments were meant to convey. If it was a series of mis-taps or formatting errors, confirm and we\u2019ll move on. Continued opacity will be treated as scum refusal to commit to a stance.\n\nPending satisfactory explanation, I intend to vote [5] at the close of these rounds.\n[Player 5] I think [5]\n[Player 3] lier posts, but due to typos and incomplete text, the statements appeared unclear. I apologize for the confusion\u2014my intention was not to mislead, but to express my perspective that Player 1 appears genuine in their reasoning and neutrality so far.\n\nHowever, while I\u2019ve had lapses in clarity, the focus should remain on Player 0. Their aggressive push to eliminate me early on, without clear reasoning, raises concerns. Their behavior could be consistent with someone trying to control the narrative\u2014a known Mafia tactic to eliminate potentially influential townsfolk like myself.\n\nI understand the urge to pin behavior on me due to my earlier mistakes, but let\u2019s not overlook Player 0\u2019s pattern. They\u2019ve been one of the most active in trying to steer the vote, which deserves scrutiny. That said, I\u2019ve clarified my statements now, and I hope this puts those concerns to rest.\n\nNow my vote is firmly **[0]**\u2014their behavior warrants reconsideration, and I believe they are hiding more than they let on.\n[Player 0]  [5]\n[Player 1] ### Vote: \n[5]\n\nThe discussion has revealed significant suspicious behavior from Player 5, including repeated vague statements and a failure to clarify despite multiple requests. The behavior of Player 5, especially after being under scrutiny, aligns with typical Mafia tactics to avoid detection and create confusion. Given the evidence and discussions, I believe voting for Player 5 is the most reasonable decision.\n\n### Vote: [5]\n[Player 4]  \u2013 Day 2, Round 2  \n\n- My N0 check on [2] = Mafia \u2192 confirmed mafia, lynched yesterday.  \n- My N1 check on [3] = NOT mafia \u2192 3 cleared.  \n\nThat leaves [0, 1, 5] possible scum.
