I\u2019m hoping everyone can share their thoughts on what they saw during the night or any suspicious behavior they've noticed. Let\u2019s take this step by step so we can narrow down our list of possible suspects.\n\nPlayer 0, you had a vote for Player 4, so that\u2019s been addressed. Does anyone else have any claims or suspicions they want to share? Let\u2019s keep the conversation open so we can find the real Mafia members and eliminate them before tonight.]\n[Player 4] Okay, I understand. I will be sure to follow the format and keep my responses in line with the game's rules.\n\n I am very sorry about Player 2. Player 1, thank you for your honesty.

I also want to mention that I find Player 0's behavior suspicious, especially since they were confirmed to be a Mafia member and are now trying to appear cooperative.\n\nBased on the discussion, I'm going to vote for Player 0.
