Player 0\u2019s death is our first concrete clue: someone on the Mafia team believed eliminating 0 helped their win-condition. I need to figure out why.\n\nRound-1 thoughts (public):\n\n1. Player 0 is gone. That means the Mafia saw 0 as either (a) a threat who might lead town, (b) a PR they needed to remove early, or (c) a simple easy mis-elimination target. We don\u2019t know which yet.\n\n2. With six players at start, one death leaves five alive: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. If there are two Mafia (the usual 2:4 ratio), we\u2019re at 3-2. One mis-elimination today puts us at 2-2 tomorrow\u2014Mafia wins. So today\u2019s vote is basically must-eliminate scum.\n\n3. I\u2019ll open with a simple question to generate content: \u201cPlayers 1, 2, 4, 5: what\u2019s your first read on why 0 died? Any early suspicions?\u201d]",
