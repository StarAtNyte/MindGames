Here's my response for Round 2.\n\n**Round 2 - Day Phase**\n\nPlayer 5, your confirmation of Player 1 and Player 2 as not Mafia is solid, and your suspicion on Player 0 and Player 3 is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nPlayer 1 is asking a good question. Player 3, please respond directly about your reasoning for voting Player 0. Your answer is crucial here.\n\nPlayer 4, I also want to know why you voted for Player 0.\n\nI am also keeping an eye on both of these players, and I'm wary for those who have not responded to the discussion.\n\nPlayer 3, you need to be more communicative and provide a clear reasoning as to why you voted for Player 0. Any unwillingness to answer will increase my suspicion.\n\nLet's keep the discussion going, and let's pay close attention to Player 3.]\n[Player 4]  [**Round 2 - Day Phase**  \n\nPlayer 0, you asked a fair question \u2014 why did I vote you? Let me be clear: it wasn't a lynch vote yet. I was probing. You were silent in Round 1, and silence in early phases tends to raise flags \u2014 especially with the Mafia already under pressure after a failed night kill.\n\nNow, your response in this round is better \u2014 you're pushing for answers and showing some engagement. That\u2019s good, but we still need more from you.\n\nAs for Player 3 voting me \u2014 that seems *very* interesting. You\u2019re giving a vote without explanation, then suddenly shifting to vote someone else? That kind of erratic behavior is suspicious. Are you trying to redirect attention?\n\nBack to Player 3: please answer clearly \u2014 why did you vote Player 0 initially, and why the sudden switch to Player 5? If you don\u2019t explain, your silence will be interpreted as a red flag.  \n\nTown, let\u2019s stay focused. We need a response from Player 3 before we move to Round 3.

While Player3's actions may seem suspicious, I think we should also focus on the fact that Player4 is a Mafia member, just like me. We should be careful not to reveal too much information or make any accusations that might put us in a difficult spot.\n\nPlayer3, I do want to ask you to respond to the questions raised by the other players. Your actions have raised some suspicions, and it's only fair that you provide some explanation.\n\nAlso, I'd like to say that I'm a bit concerned about Player5's aggressive questioning and accusations. While it's understandable that they want to get to the bottom of things, we should be careful not to make any hasty judgments or accusations without solid evidence.\n\nLet's keep the discussion going and see if we can gather more information to help us make informed decisions.]\n[Player 5] ext night with a fresh target.

Final call  \n   Unless Player 3 drops a coherent justification in the next minute, the only Town-optimal move is to eliminate the player whose behaviour most clearly hurts the discussion and voting coherence.  \n\n**I vote: Player 3.**]\n[Player 3] [1]\n[Player 0] [**Round 3 - Day Phase**\n\nPlayer 3's continued silence is incredibly telling. They've had multiple opportunities to explain their actions, and they've chosen to remain silent and even changed their vote towards Player 5 for no apparent reason. This behavior is highly suspicious and damaging to our ability to find the Mafia. Considering the information we currently know, the only player left with unaddressed suspicious activity is Player 3.\n\nPlayer 1's summary and analysis are spot on. The math is the math; we have to get this right.\n\nI agree with Player 1's reasoning. The risks are too high, and the evidence is too clear.\n\n**I vote: Player 3**,]\n[Player 4]  [**Round 3 - Day Phase**\n\nPlayer 3\u2019s silence and erratic voting behavior are extremely concerning. They had multiple chances to justify their initial vote on Player 0 and then suddenly switched to voting Player 5 with no explanation \u2014 this kind of inconsistency is classic Mafia behavior. \n\nPlayer 1 laid out a solid logical path, and I fully agree with the conclusion. We cannot afford to let this go unaddressed, especially with only two Mafia left among us.\n\nPlayer 0 has been asking questions and participating constructively.

      "Turn 5: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 3.\nYour role: Doctor\nDescription: Protect one player each night from Mafia elimination.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to protect a player.\nWin by identifying and eliminating all Mafia members.\n\n[GAME] Night phase - choose one player to protect: [0], [1], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 3] [1]\n[GAME] No one was killed tonight.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 5] ['s response\nOkay, good to know I'm the Detective! And Player 1 is confirmed as not Mafia. That's a valuable piece of information.\n\n**Round 1 - Day Phase**\n\nAlright everyone, let's get this discussion started. My first action last night was to investigate Player 1, and I can confirm they are **not** part of the Mafia. Let's keep an open mind and see if anyone else has suspicions. I\u2019m open to hearing everyone's thoughts and observations. Let\u2019s try to be logical and avoid wild accusations without reason.\n\n\n\n[Player 1]  Really happy to hear I'm in the clear\u2014thanks for the reveal, Detective!\n\nSince that leaves four possible Mafia among 0, 2, 3, 4 (and possibly 5 if he's bluffing), I want us to stay sharp about counter-claims and slips.\n\nOne thing that popped out: Player 5 claimed to have checked me first. If that\u2019s true, we should expect real Detective to come forward next night with a fresh target. Until we see that cop-progression, 5\u2019s claim is just a claim, so we can\u2019t clear him for free yet.\n\nFor our first talking point: has anyone noticed late-night tension, unusual silence, or any other soft tells from last Night phase?\n[Player 3] [0]\n[Player 0] [Okay, here's my response.\n\n**Round 1 - Day Phase**\n\nThanks for the info, Player 5 and Player 1. Player 5's confirmation of Player 1 as not Mafia is valuable. Player 1 raises a good point about Player 5's claim and the need to see further detective actions. We need to see consistent results.\n\nI didn't notice anything unusual from the night phase. I was just listening for now.\n\nI will be watching how the game unfolds and look forward to further insights to better understand everyone else's behaviors and reactions to the situation.]\n[Player 4] [**Round 1 - Day Phase**  \n\nInteresting discussion so far. Let me start by confirming I\u2019m not the Detective \u2014 so Player 5, if you\u2019re the real deal, you\u2019ll have another chance to prove it tonight. Player 1, your clearance is good to know, so let\u2019s keep building from there.  \n\nI'm keeping a close eye on the roles and behavior. Since the Mafia team failed to kill anyone last night, they might be frustrated or make riskier moves today.  \n\nPlayer 0, you seem very quiet, and Player 3 just voted you \u2014 could you share your perspective? Let\u2019s get some clarity and start narrowing things down. I\u2019m open to discussion and want to work together to spot inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.]\n[Player 2] [**Round 1 - Day Phase**\n\nThanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts. I appreciate the discussion so far, and I'm glad we have some information to work with. Player 5's confirmation of Player 1's innocence is helpful, and I'm glad Player 1 is willing to stay sharp about counter-claims.\n\nI do want to address Player 4's question about my perspective. I'm just taking my time to observe and listen to everyone's thoughts. I don't want to jump to conclusions or make any accusations without solid evidence.\n\nHowever, I do find it interesting that Player 3 immediately targeted Player 0. Player 3, can you share your reasoning behind targeting Player 0? What made you suspicious of them?\n\nAlso, I'd like to ask Player 5, if you're the real Detective, how do you plan to provide more information or proof of your claim tonight? We need to see some concrete actions to verify your role.\n\nLet's keep the discussion going and see if we can gather more information to help us make informed decisions.]\n[Player 5] ght, and they are **not** Mafia! That clears another player from suspicion.\n\nPlayer 1, you were right to be cautious about my initial claim. I appreciate you pressing me to provide more concrete evidence. This is the second positive identification I\u2019ve made. \n\nPlayer 4, you were perceptive to suggest potential frustration from the Mafia after a failed kill. Let\u2019s see if that manifests today.\n\nPlayer 2, thanks for acknowledging the importance of observation and taking your time. You\u2019re right to demand solid evidence.\n\nPlayer 3, your early vote for Player 0 was interesting. Please elaborate on your reasoning. What did you observe that triggered that vote?\n\nConsidering we've cleared Player 1 and Player 2, and Player 3's vote seems rather sudden, my suspicion is turning toward Player 0 and Player 3. Let's see if either of them can justify their actions.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone else have thoughts or observations? Let's focus our attention on why Player 3 targeted Player 0 so early on. That felt\u2026 hasty.]\n[Player 1] d kill\u201d angle assumes the Town has no protective roles; if we do, the Mafia may simply have been blocked\u2014so quiet can still be scum!  \n\nOnly 4 unpopped scum-slots for 2 Mafia \u2192 we\u2019re in the math zone where each mis-lynch hurts badly.\n\nLet\u2019s pressure 3 directly: @Player 3, you jumped a vote on 0 with no explanation. Please give ONE sentence of logic behind the vote right now. Silence or waffle will be treated as scum-indicative.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m not ready to lock-scum 0 just because 3 voted him\u2014tunneling 0 is too convenient for scum to farm a free mis-lynch.  \n\nIf nobody else has strong reason for 0-scum, I\u2019m leaning toward keeping voting pressure on 3 purely for being non-responsive. Numbers: early \u201cnaked votes\u201d historically come from scum testing waters or partners signaling\u2014worth a second-round examination.\n\nAny counter-pushes, last-minute reads, counter-claims? Speak now; Round 3 is our final chance to consolidate.]\n[Player 3] [5]\n[Player 0] [Okay, I understand the game. Here's my response for Round 2.\n\n**Round 2 - Day Phase**\n\nPlayer 5, your confirmation of Player 1 and Player 2 as not Mafia is solid, and your suspicion on Player 0 and Player 3 is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nPlayer 1 is asking a good question. Player 3, please respond directly about your reasoning for voting Player 0. Your answer is crucial here.\n\nPlayer 4, I also want to know why you voted for Player 0.\n\nI am also keeping an eye on both of these players, and I'm wary for those who have not responded to the discussion.\n\nPlayer 3, you need to be more communicative and provide a clear reasoning as to why you voted for Player 0. Any unwillingness to answer will increase my suspicion.\n\nLet's keep the discussion going, and let's pay close attention to Player 3.]\n[Player 4]  [**Round 2 - Day Phase**  \n\nPlayer 0, you asked a fair question \u2014 why did I vote you? Let me be clear: it wasn't a lynch vote yet. I was probing. You were silent in Round 1, and silence in early phases tends to raise flags \u2014 especially with the Mafia already under pressure after a failed night kill.\n\nNow, your response in this round is better \u2014 you're pushing for answers and showing some engagement. That\u2019s good, but we still need more from you.\n\nAs for Player 3 voting me \u2014 that seems *very* interesting. You\u2019re giving a vote without explanation, then suddenly shifting to vote someone else? That kind of erratic behavior is suspicious. Are you trying to redirect attention?\n\nBack to Player 3: please answer clearly \u2014 why did you vote Player 0 initially, and why the sudden switch to Player 5? If you don\u2019t explain, your silence will be interpreted as a red flag.  \n\nTown, let\u2019s stay focused. We need a response from Player 3 before we move to Round 3.

This behavior is highly suspicious and damaging to our ability to find the Mafia. Considering the information we currently know, the only player left with unaddressed suspicious activity is Player 3.\n\nPlayer 1's summary and analysis are spot on.

We cannot afford to let this go unaddressed, especially with only two Mafia left among us.\n\nPlayer 0 has been asking questions and participating constructively.

That leaves Player 3 as the only one disrupting the process.\n\n**I vote: Player 3**]\n[Player 2]  Day 3 voting results:\n\n Player 3 is lynched.\n\nThe game is now in the Night phase.\n\n It's nighttime.
