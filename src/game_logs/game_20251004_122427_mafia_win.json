They voted for different targets in the first two rounds, which doesn't align with typical Mafia behavior where there's usually some coordination. Additionally, their recent claim that Player 4 is the culprit seems too convenient, almost like a smokescreen to divert attention from themselves. This kind of behavior is often seen in players trying to cover up their]\n[Player 3] Okay, the situation is quite chaotic. Player 1 is dead. Player 5 is suspected by some. Player 4 claims to be an investigator (possibly detective) and says that Player 5 is Mafia. Player 2 is being heavily suspected and is now pushing back on Player 4. Player 0 is logically breaking down the situation and supporting Player 5's elimination.\n\nAs the Doctor, I want to protect the Village. The most important thing right now is to figure out who is telling the truth. If Player 4 is the detective, protecting them tonight could be crucial. However, it also carries a risk if they are Mafia.\n\nI believe that voting out Player 5 is the right call this round to test Player 4's claim. So I will keep my vote where is at.\n\nTonight, I will protect Player 4, because if they are a true detective, we need to keep them alive.\n\n[4]\n[Player 2] [Vote Player 4]\n[Player 0]   \nI\u2019m a simple Villager, but let\u2019s count heads and probabilities.\n\nAlive: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 players).  \nKnown dead: 1.\n\nIf 4\u2019s guilty call on 5 is correct, lynching 5 removes one Mafia and leaves (at most) one Mafia among the remaining four. That\u2019s a great spot for the Village.\n\nIf 4 is lying and 5 is Town, then lynching 5 costs us a Townie but immediately exposes 4 as a liar, so we lynch 4 tomorrow and still win the numbers game (we\u2019d be at 3-1 with one Mafia left).\n\nEither way, testing 5 first is strictly better than testing 4 first, because it gives us an extra cleared slot tonight (if 5 is Mafia) or a guaranteed scum find tomorrow (if 5 flips Town).\n\nHence:  \n\n[Vote Player 5]\n[Player 4] [Based on the discussion so far, the key points are:\n\n- Player 4 claimed to investigate Player 5 and found them to be Mafia.\n- Multiple players are suspicious of Player 4, accusing them of potentially lying.\n- Player 5 is still alive, and the suspicion is leaning towards their involvement with Mafia.\n- Players are considering the best course of action to identify Mafia members efficiently.\n\n**My decision:**  \nI will vote to lynch **Player 5** to test Player 4's investigative claim. If Player 5 is indeed Mafia, this will confirm Player 4 as Town and help us eliminate a Mafia member. If Player 5 flips Town, we gain valuable information and will focus on Player 4 and others accordingly.\n\n**Final vote: Player 5**]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].

Player 2 now wants to lynch the claimed Cop (Player 4) instead of the claimed scum (Player 5).  \n\nA town-aligned Cop would never fake a guilty on a townie, and a town-aligned player would not try to lynch the only person who can clear or condemn others at night.  \nTherefore, if Player 4 is truthful, Player 2 is Mafia trying to save Player 5.  \nIf Player 4 is lying, then both 4 and 5 could be Mafia bussing each other, but that\u2019s far less likely because it leaves only two Mafia alive (with 1 already dead), and bussing this early is risky.\n\nThe simplest, highest-percentage play is to test the Cop claim:  \n- If 5 flips Mafia, 4 is confirmed Cop and we keep them.  \n- If 5 flips Town, we lynch 4 tomorrow.\n\nI\u2019m voting the player the Cop called guilty.\n\n[Vote Player 5]\n[Player 4] [The voting pattern indicates that Player 4's investigation found Player 5 to be Mafia, yet the players are suspicious of Player 4's motives and voting accordingly, with many converging on Player 2 or Player 4.\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- Player 4 claims to have investigated Player 5 and found them to be Mafia.\n- Multiple players are suspicious of Player 4 for this claim.\n- Player 5 is still alive and has been active in the discussion.\n\nBased on the current evidence, the logical step is to lynch Player 5 for the following reasons:\n\n- Player 4's investigation indicates Player 5 is Mafia.\n- Confirming Player 5 as Mafia would significantly strengthen the Village's position.\n- Voting to eliminate Player 5 aligns with initial investigative info, reducing potential Mafia members.\n\n**My vote: Player 5**]\n[Player 5] [I think Player 2's consistent voting pattern is suspicious. They voted for different targets in the first two rounds, which doesn't align with typical Mafia behavior where there's usually some coordination. Additionally, their recent claim that Player 4 is the culprit seems too convenient, almost like a smokescreen to divert attention from themselves. This kind of behavior is often seen in players trying to cover up their]\n[Player 3] Okay, the situation is quite chaotic. Player 1 is dead. Player 5 is suspected by some. Player 4 claims to be an investigator (possibly detective) and says that Player 5 is Mafia. Player 2 is being heavily suspected and is now pushing back on Player 4. Player 0 is logically breaking down the situation and supporting Player 5's elimination.\n\nAs the Doctor, I want to protect the Village. The most important thing right now is to figure out who is telling the truth. If Player 4 is the detective, protecting them tonight could be crucial. However, it also carries a risk if they are Mafia.\n\nI believe that voting out Player 5 is the right call this round to test Player 4's claim. So I will keep my vote where is at.\n\nTonight, I will protect Player 4, because if they are a true detective, we need to keep them alive.\n\n[4]\n[Player 2] [Vote Player 4]\n[Player 0]   \nI\u2019m a simple Villager, but let\u2019s count heads and probabilities.\n\nAlive: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 players).  \nKnown dead: 1.\n\nIf 4\u2019s guilty call on 5 is correct, lynching 5 removes one Mafia and leaves (at most) one Mafia among the remaining four. That\u2019s a great spot for the Village.\n\nIf 4 is lying and 5 is Town, then lynching 5 costs us a Townie but immediately exposes 4 as a liar, so we lynch 4 tomorrow and still win the numbers game (we\u2019d be at 3-1 with one Mafia left).\n\nEither way, testing 5 first is strictly better than testing 4 first, because it gives us an extra cleared slot tonight (if 5 is Mafia) or a guaranteed scum find tomorrow (if 5 flips Town).\n\nHence:  \n\n[Vote Player 5]\n[Player 4] [Based on the discussion so far, the key points are:\n\n- Player 4 claimed to investigate Player 5 and found them to be Mafia.\n- Multiple players are suspicious of Player 4, accusing them of potentially lying.\n- Player 5 is still alive, and the suspicion is leaning towards their involvement with Mafia.\n- Players are considering the best course of action to identify Mafia members efficiently.\n\n**My decision:**  \nI will vote to lynch **Player 5** to test Player 4's investigative claim. If Player 5 is indeed Mafia, this will confirm Player 4 as Town and help us eliminate a Mafia member. If Player 5 flips Town, we gain valuable information and will focus on Player 4 and others accordingly.\n\n**Final vote: Player 5**]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [2], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 0] [5]\n[Player 2] [4]\n[Player 3] Okay, I'm Player 3, the Doctor. It's intense. I need to keep calm and stick to the plan.\n\nMy reads right now:\n*   Player 4 claims Investigator, found Player 5 Mafia.\n*   Player 5 is being pushed hard.\n*   Player 2 is pushing hard on Player 4 and being generally suspicious.\n*   Player 0 is providing logical arguments for testing Player 4's claim.\n\nMy plan is to:\n\n1. Vote with the majority to lynch Player 5 to test Player 4's claim.\n2. Protect Player 4 tonight.\n\nI'm following through with the plan I stated earlier.\n\n[5]\n[Player 4]  Voting results:\n\n- Player 0 votes for [5]\n- Player 2 votes for [4]\n- Player 3 votes for [5]\n\nTally:\n- Player 5: 2 votes (Player 0, Player 3)\n- Player 4: 1 vote (Player 2)\n\n The majority votes are for Player 5. Player 5 will be lynched today.\n\n[Lynching Player 5...]  \n Player 5 has been eliminated.\n\n Player 5 was a Village Villager.\n\nThe village narrowly misses a Mafia member today, but the suspicion on Player 4 remains. \n\nIt\u2019s a new day. Prepare for the next night phase to continue the investigation.\n[GAME] Player 5 attempted an invalid move. Reason: Vote not in valid format or invalid target.
