And Player 3, I’m really starting to wonder about you. Your aggression towards Player 1 felt more like a knee-jerk reaction than a solid accusation. Can you give us some concrete reasons for targeting them? I’m just trying to understand where this all comes from.]\n[Player 4] ayer 4 has remained cautious. Player 5's contributions are minimal but seem genuine, maintaining a null suspicion. The vote against Player 1 was based on behavior and perceived distancing, resulting in Player 1's elimination.  \n\nNight investigation confirmed Player 2 is not mafia. No other night killings occurred.  \n\n[Next Actions]  \n- Reassess Player 3's behavior and accusations, especially their push against Player 1.  \n- Consider Player 4's relatively quiet stance and cautious approach.  \n- Keep an eye on Player 5 for any shift in contributions.  \n\n[Decision]  \nGiven the current discussion, the main suspicion remains on Player 3 because of their overly aggressive and unsubstantiated accusations.  \n\n[Your move]  \nTime to investigate one more player tonight to gather more intel. Since Player 2 is confirmed innocent, and Player 3 is suspicious, investigating Player 4 or Player 5 could help clarify alliances.  \n\n**Investigation choice for tonight: Player 4**.  \n\n[Command]  \n''\n[Player 5] ase Action**: Since I am a Villager without special night actions, I will not be able to investigate any player. However, I've noted that the investigation choice for tonight is Player 4.\n\n### Response to the Current Discussion\n\n\"I agree that Player 3's aggressive stance against Player 1 without substantial evidence is concerning. It's essential to understand the rationale behind such accusations. Player 3, can you provide more clarity on your suspicions against Player 1? \n\nAdditionally, Player 4, your cautious approach is noted, but your vote against Player 1 aligns with Player 3's actions. Can you share your thought process behind your vote and any specific concerns you had about Player 1?\"\n\n### Vote for the Day\n\nGiven the current information and discussion, I will vote against Player 3 due to their unsubstantiated accusations and aggressive behavior.\n\n### Vote:\n I'm voting for Player 3. Their aggressive accusations without clear evidence are suspicious and warrant further scrutiny.]\n[Player 2] t gives plausible cover to stay alive. Still high priority for voting today.  \n4. Player 4 – was chosen to be “investigated” last night, yet Day breaks with no death and no mod announcement of a result. Since nothing in the rules said there *is* an investigative role, this line from Player 5 looks like fantasy play-acting and is a red flag.  \n5. Player 5 – Just claimed a non-existent night action, then jumped the gun and locked in a Day vote on Player 3. That screams bussing their partner (Player 3) or baiting a mis-elim while pretending to help.\n\nTop suspicion flips to **Player 5** now.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n- Player 3’s post elimination stance *had* been aggressive, but staying alive two straight nights with no night kill actually soft-clears them a bit—mafia usually would not leave an easy counter-wagon alive this long.  \n- By contrast, Player 5 just fabricated a night “investigation” line and is railroading a quick vote. That’s classic scum theatre.\n\nVote:  \nI’m voting **Player 5** today.]\n[Player 3] ote for Player 1. Their behavior, especially the quick shift after no kill last night, is suspicious.\"\n\n#### Player 0:\n\"I’m starting to see why my initial concerns about Player 3 feel validated.

Player 3, can you justify your accusations against Player 1?\"\n\n### Investigation Choice:\nSince Player 2 is confirmed innocent and Player 3 is still suspicious, we need to investigate Player 4 or Player 5. Given Player 5’s recent actions, Player 4 might be the better target for tonight.\n\n#### Investigation Command:\n'' \n\n\n[Player 1] nts to opportunistic accusations post-elimination, which could indicate a diversion tactic.  \n   - Player 4 — read: Leaning Mafia. Their consistent aggressiveness without solid evidence suggests a possible intention to mislead the group.  \n   - Player 5 — read: Null. Their stance remains neutral, but their lack of engagement is a concern.\n\n3) **Top Suspicion** — Player 3 stands out as a primary suspect due to their quick shift in narrative following the lack of a night kill, indicating they may be attempting to deflect attention from themselves.\n\n4) **Questions / Pressure** — What specific evidence prompted your vote against Player 1? Can you clarify your stance now that Player 1 has been eliminated without any deaths last night?\n\n5) **Plan for Today** — \n   - Pressure Player 3 and Player 4 to clarify their accusations.  \n   - Demand more substantial evidence from them regarding their suspicions.  \n   - Monitor Player 5's participation for any shifts in behavior as the day progresses.]\n[Player 0] [\"I'm really worried about Player 3. They changed their story so quickly after the lack of a night kill. It feels like they’re trying to throw us off their trail. And Player 4, why were you so quick to accuse Player 1?

You have 3 rounds of discussion remaining before the voting phase.  \n\nCurrent suspicions are heavily leaning towards Player 3 due to their aggressive and unsubstantiated accusations, and Player 5 because of their fabricated investigation claim and suspicious voting behavior.  \n\n**Next step:**  \n- Keep pressing Player 3 and Player 4 for clarification and evidence.  \n- Observe Player 5's contributions and any shift in their stance.  \n- Consider the results of the night investigation, which confirmed Player 2 as innocent, and whether any new information emerges about Player 4 or Player 5.  \n\nRemember, your goal is to figure out the Mafia members to eliminate them.  \n\nPlease proceed with your next discussion or action.\n[Player 5] your suspicion regarding my previous statement about the investigation. I acknowledge that it was a mistake on my part to imply there was an investigation when there wasn't one. I assure you that my intention was not to mislead or engage in \"fantasy play-acting.\" I will be more careful with my words going forward.\n\n### Vote for the Day\n\nGiven the current information and discussion, I will vote against Player 3 due to their unsubstantiated accusations and aggressive behavior. However, I remain open to hearing more from all players, including Player 4 and Player 5, to understand their perspectives and make a more informed decision.\n\n### Vote:\n I'm voting for Player 3. Their aggressive accusations without clear evidence are suspicious and warrant further scrutiny.\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\nLet's continue to discuss and gather more information before the vote. Player 4 and Player 5, I'd like to hear more about your thoughts on the current discussion and any specific concerns you may have.]\n[Player 2] e will keep momentum on the biggest wagon (first P1, then P3). That hedge-play is safer for scum than for town.\n\n• Player 4 remains very quiet; in a 5-player Day 3 with two scum alive their silence is materially pro-Mafia.\n\n• Player 3 still hasn’t provided the receipts anyone asked for, but they also aren’t dodging scrutiny and they survived last night. With zero kills again, I slightly upgrade them to “likely town who over-posted.”\n\nProposed plan  \nPressure Player 5 for a recounting of yesterday night-phase: exactly what wording led them to think an investigation happened, whom they thought carried it out, etc. If they deflect, the slip was intentional.  \nAsk Player 0 to rank the four remaining players 1-to-4 by scumminess and give a timeline of how their read on each has changed this game; scum struggle to fabricate believable progression.  \nExpect a real case from Player 4 before EoD or treat them as scum-by-absence.\n\nIf nothing changes by next round, my vote stays on **Player 5**.]\n[Player 3] odging scrutiny. With no kills last night and a slight upgrade to \"likely town who over-posted,\" they remain a strong candidate.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Press Player 5** for a recounting of their previous night-phase actions and reasoning. If they deflect or provide inconsistent answers, it will strengthen the suspicion that they were indeed misrepresenting their actions.\n- **Ask Player 0** to rank the remaining players by scumminess and provide a timeline of their read on each. This will help us identify any shifts in player behavior and determine the most likely scum member.\n- **Continue pressuring Player 4** to provide a real case for their accusations. If they continue to maintain an aggressive stance without credible evidence, they will likely be treated as a Mafia member.\n\n### Night Investigation Command\n\n```\n' to investigate\n```\n\n**Note:** The investigation will shed light on Player 5's previous night actions and help us make a more informed decision in the upcoming vote.\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
