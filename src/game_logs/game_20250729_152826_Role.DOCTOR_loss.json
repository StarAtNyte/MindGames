      "Turn 6: \n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 3.\nYour role: Doctor\nDescription: Protect one player each night from Mafia elimination.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to protect a player.\nWin by identifying and eliminating all Mafia members.\n\n[GAME] Night phase - choose one player to protect: [0], [1], [2], [4], [5]\n[Player 3] [0]\n[GAME] Player 2 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 3] [0]\n[Player 4]  I am the Detective and investigated Player 3 during the night. I can confirm they are **not** a member of the Mafia. Player 2 was killed during the night, so we must identify who is responsible. Since Player 3 is safe, focus should shift to the remaining players. I will remain objective and evaluate all claims carefully. Who killed Player 2, and who should we vote for?  \n\n Let the discussion continue for one more round before voting. If my role is relevant, I will clarify further.  \n\n Based on the evidence (Player 3 is innocent) and the accusation from Player 3 toward Player 0, I firmly vote to eliminate **Player 0**. They are the prime suspect.\n[Player 0] oesn't necessarily mean we should start pointing fingers at me. \n\nI think it's interesting that Player 3 accused me right off the bat. Maybe they were trying to deflect attention or maybe they genuinely believe I'm a threat. But what about Player 4's investigation? It only confirmed Player 3's innocence, not mine or anyone else's. \n\nLet's not forget, there's a Mafia among us, and their goal is to blend in. If I were a Mafia member, would I be so openly accused and not defend myself more... persuasively? Perhaps we should consider the possibility that the real Mafia member is trying to manipulate us by being accused. \n\nHowever, given that Player 4 has found Player 3 to be innocent and without further information, I must assume Player 4's role as Detective is genuine. \n\nConsidering the discussion and to turn the tables, I accuse... Player 1. They haven't given us much information about themselves yet, and it seems like they are trying to stay under the radar. What do you know, Player 1?]\n[Player 5]  I think we should focus on the facts. Player 4 confirmed Player 3's innocence, so we know two people who are likely not Mafia. That leaves us with Player 0, Player 1, and myself as unverified.\n\nPlayer 0 was the first to be accused, and while they may not be guilty, the fact that they were targeted early is suspicious. Also, if they were truly innocent, wouldn't they be more eager to help find the killer instead of deflecting and pointing fingers at someone else?\n\nAs for Player 1, they have been quiet so far. That could mean they are trying to stay under the radar, which is classic Mafia behavior. However, we have no direct evidence against them yet.\n\nI agree with Player 4 \u2014 we should focus on Player 0 for now. Unless Player 1 or Player 5 come forward with information, there's no reason to vote for anyone else.  \n\n**I support voting for Player 0.**\n[Player 1]  I understand the suspicion around Player 0, but I think it's important we don't jump to conclusions. Player 3 was accused early, and while they were proven innocent, that doesn't mean the accusations were without merit. \n\nPlayer 0 is not the only one with something to hide. Player 1 has been quiet, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m guilty. I\u2019m just trying to listen and evaluate the situation carefully. The important thing is to focus on the evidence, not just on who is being accused. \n\nPlayer 4 has confirmed Player 3's innocence, which is progress. But what about the rest of us? I think we need to be cautious about who we accuse next. If we accuse the wrong person, we risk protecting the real Mafia. \n\n[Player 3] [This kill pattern shows strategic targeting. We should protect similar analytical players.]\n[Player 4] *Player 1** - if they\u2019re guilty, my next action proves it.  \n\n[Player 2\u2019s killer: Player 1.
