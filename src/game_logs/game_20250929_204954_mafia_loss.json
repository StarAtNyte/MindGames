The result was conclusive \u2013 Player\u202f0 was indeed a Mafia member, and they were eliminated during the night.  \n\nThat leaves **one Mafia** among the remaining players: 1,\u202f3,\u202f4, and\u202f5.  \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve observed so far, Player\u202f4 has spoken the least and has not contributed much to the early discussion. While low activity can be a legit strategy, it\u2019s also a classic way for Mafia to stay under the radar.  \n\nGiven the limited information we have, I\u2019d like to suggest that we **focus our suspicion on Player\u202f4** for the upcoming vote, unless someone has strong counter\u2011evidence.  \n\nWhat does everyone think? Any other observations or reasons to consider a different target?\n[Player 1]   \nI\u2019m just a regular villager, and I\u2019m not convinced by Player 2\u2019s \u201cDetective\u201d claim.  \n\n1. No solid proof: anybody can type \u201cI\u2019m the Detective\u201d.  \n2. No reason to trust Player 0 was Mafia\u2014if the real Detective had investigated a scum, they\u2019d probably keep it quiet to avoid outing themselves.  \n3. Pushing a quick wagon on quiet Player 4 feels like an easy mis-eliminate.  \n\nMy read: Player 2\u2019s claim is either a lucky guess or a Mafia distraction. Until we see real evidence, I\u2019m not voting 4 just because they\u2019re quiet. Let\u2019s hear from Players 3 and 4 first, then decide.\n[Player 3] t, anyone can claim to be the Detective. The fact that Player 2 is so readily revealing information (assuming it's true) raises a flag for me. Why reveal their role so early if they are the real Detective?\n\n*   **Player 4's inactivity:** While it could be a Mafia tactic, it's also perfectly reasonable for a player to be quiet early on, especially if they're new or trying to assess the situation. Let's see if Player 4 offers any insights in this round of discussion if they want to avoid the current suspicion.\n\n*   **Player 5's observation:** Player 5's early remarks about Player 0 and keeping an eye on everyone is a sound strategy to me.\n\n**My current position:**\n\nI'm hesitant to vote for Player 4 at this point. I want to hear more from them and see if we can get any further information. I am leaning towards Player 2 being a Mafia and trying to mislead the villagers.\n\n**Action:** I'll be paying close attention to Player 2. Let's see what Player 4 has to say in this round of discussion.]\n[Player 4]  I'm the Doctor, and I protected Player 3 during the night. I didn't protect Player 0 because I didn't believe they were a target. I think the Mafia might have killed Player 0 to create confusion, but I don't know for sure.  \n\nFrom what I've seen so far, I don't think I'm the Mafia. I've been focused on protecting someone and haven't spoken much because I wanted to avoid drawing attention. I don't think Player 2 is the real Detective either\u2014they revealed too much too soon.  \n\nI'm not trying to deflect suspicion, but I believe the Mafia is among the others. I'll keep protecting someone tonight and try to stay safe. Let's figure this out together.\n[Player 5] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they've been deflecting attention and questioning the Detective claim aggressively. Their behavior seems calculated to shift focus away from themselves, which aligns with typical Mafia tactics. Additionally, Player 4's revelation as the Doctor adds another layer of complexity, making us question the validity of Player 2's claims even more.]\n[Player 2] y the system; it\u2019s purely a claim. If Player\u202f4 were Mafia, they could be using the Doctor role as a cover to appear helpful while staying off the radar.\n\n**What I propose for the vote**\n\n- **Vote for Player\u202f4.**  \n  \u2022 They have spoken the least, which is a classic Mafia tactic to avoid drawing attention.  \n  \u2022 Their Doctor claim cannot be confirmed, whereas my Detective claim is corroborated by the game\u2019s night feedback.  \n  \u2022 Removing Player\u202f4 will either eliminate the second Mafia outright or at least force the real Doctor (if Player\u202f4 is indeed the Doctor) to reveal themselves later, giving us more information.\n\nIf anyone has strong evidence that points to another player (e.g., a concrete alibi for Player\u202f4, or a reason why my investigative result could be fabricated), please share it now. Otherwise, I\u2019ll ask the town to focus the lynch on Player\u202f4 to give us the best chance of clearing the remaining Mafia. \n\nLet\u2019s keep the discussion going\u2014any additional observations or questions?]\n[Player 1] [Player 1:  \nWe now have three unconfirmed claims in one round:  \n- Player 2 \u2192 \u201cDetective\u201d whose only check is on a dead scum that we can\u2019t verify.  \n- Player 4 \u2192 \u201cDoctor\u201d whose save is on a still-living target (Player 3) that we also can\u2019t verify.  \n- Everyone else, including me, claims Villager.  \n\nBoth claims are equally weak until a living person corroborates them.  \nI\u2019m sticking with my earlier read: the loudest, most directive voice is often the Mafia trying to steer the vote. That\u2019s still Player 2.  \n\nI want to hear Player 3\u2019s reaction to being told they were \u201cprotected,\u201d then we decide.]\n[Player 3] on.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n*   **Player 2:** Continues to push the Detective claim strongly, trying to control the narrative. I still have questions about why the Detective would reveal such information so freely. **Leaning Mafia**\n*   **Player 4:** Claims Doctor and saved Player 3. This complicates things. If they are the Doctor, they would be telling the truth about Player 2. If they are Mafia, then there's a chance that Player 2 is also Mafia. **Probably not Mafia**\n*   **Player 5:** Has a good read on the situation. They are also skeptical of Player 2. **Leaning Village**\n*   **Player 1:** Is also skeptical of Player 2. **Leaning Village**\n*   **My Role:** I was protected by Player 4.\n\n**My Plan:**\nI need to find out who is lying. If Player 4 is telling the truth about protecting me, then he is the Doctor and is probably not Mafia. If Player 2 is Mafia as I suspect, then they may not be able to convince others to vote according to them.\n\n**Vote:**\nI will vote to eliminate Player 2.]\n[Player 4]  Protect [3]\n[Player 5] [I think Player 2 is acting suspiciously because they've been deflecting attention and questioning the Detective claim aggressively. Their behavior seems calculated to shift focus away from themselves, which aligns with typical Mafia tactics. Additionally, Player 4's revelation as the Doctor adds credibility to the idea that Player 2 might be trying to mislead us.]\n[Player 2] [Vote] Player 4\n[Player 1]   \nI\u2019m a plain villager, and I still don\u2019t buy either of the two role-claims.  \n\n- Player 2\u2019s \u201cDetective\u201d story is unverifiable and, more importantly, the only thing it has accomplished is to put a spotlight on Player 4.  \n- Player 4\u2019s \u201cDoctor\u201d story is equally unverifiable and conveniently paints them as helpful while giving them an excuse for earlier silence.  \n\nBoth claims appeared only after the first real pressure started. That timing is classic Mafia theatre: one scum claims a blue role, the other scum counter-claims a different blue role, and the village tears itself apart trying to decide which liar to believe.  \n\nI\u2019m not willing to lynch on unverified claims. The only objective fact we have is that Player 2 has been the loudest, most directive voice since the moment discussion opened. In my experience, that behaviour is more often scum than town.  \n\nTherefore:  \n[Vote] Player 2\n[Player 3] Okay, I am a Villager, and I need to find the Mafia. Here's my analysis:\n\n*   **Player 2:** Still very suspect. The initial claim of being the Detective and then pushing the vote on Player 4 really makes them a prime suspect. I lean towards Mafia.\n*   **Player 4:** Claims Doctor and protected me. This adds complexity. If they're telling the truth, they're a valuable town role. This makes me lean towards not Mafia.\n*   **Player 1:** Skeptical of both claims, leaning towards Player 2 being Mafia.\n*   **Player 5:** Also seemingly leaning towards Player 2 being Mafia.\n\n**My Plan:** Based on the information, I will vote for Player 2.\n\n**Vote:**\n[Vote] Player 2\n[Player 4] [Vote] Player 2\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X].
