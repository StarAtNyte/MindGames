However, it\u2019s also possible that the Mafia wanted to create confusion. Let\u2019s look at who has been active and who has been quiet since the start. Player 1 has been quite vocal, which could mean they\u2019re trying to blend in, or it could be a red herring. Player]\n[Player 0] [1]\n[Player 1] in mind that the Mafia is always looking for any sign of division among the villagers. If we can stay united and deliberate our actions, we can increase our chances of surviving the game.\n\n**Round 3 of Day Phase**\n\n I think we need to be cautious and keep our guard up. Player 3\u2019s elimination should remind us that whoever targeted them could be a potential Mafia member. Player 4 has been quiet, which could mean they are gathering information, but it could also be a ruse. Player 1\u2019s vocal stance might be genuine, but it could also be a way to distract from their true intentions.\n\nWe should continue to gather more information through discussions and possibly try to get insights from the roles. Player 5, as the Doctor, could potentially provide crucial information during the night phases.\n\n**Voting**\n\nLet's proceed with the vote.  \n\nI will cast my vote for , as their silence and methodical approach seem suspicious to me. What are the others thinking?\n[Player 2] [I agree with you. We should look out for suspicious activities. If the detective or someone who have seen some unusual activity should help us villagers here.]\n[Player 5]  Okay, understood. I am Player 5, and I will vote for Player 4.",
