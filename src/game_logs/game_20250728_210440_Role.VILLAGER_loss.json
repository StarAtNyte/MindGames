This will make it look like there's a conflict between Player 1 and Player 5, further driving suspicion towards Player 1. Player 1 needs to agree to this plan - if Player 1 objects, then we target Player 2, as Player 2 is trying to act neutral and work everyone to together, but has not accused anyone.\n\nBut the most important thing is that Player 1 needs to vote for the same target.\n\nLet's target Player 5.\n\n\n[Player 2] [I totally understand why there's some suspicion. I propose we go around and each state our top suspect with reasoning. Then we vote for whoever has the strongest case. I think we need to pay attention to what people are actually saying and doing. Let me know if you've noticed similar patterns.]\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [2], [4], [5]"
